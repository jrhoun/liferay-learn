# System Properties

<!-- Concerned that this article is too light and doesn't really explain what purpose System Properties are - what is the System and how is it distinct from the Portal? -->

System properties configure the Liferay DXP system. The Liferay Portal application's `portal-impl.jar` embeds the default properties file:

[`system.properties`](https://docs.liferay.com/dxp/portal/7.2-latest/propertiesdoc/system.properties.html)

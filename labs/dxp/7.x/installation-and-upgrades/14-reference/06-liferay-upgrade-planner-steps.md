# Liferay Upgrade Planner Steps

As you dive into [installation upgrade details](../04-upgrading-liferay/01-introduction-to-upgrading-to-liferay-dxp-7-2.md), it's helpful to follow a list of steps, or at least note steps you've completed. The [Liferay Upgrade Planner](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner) uses the steps listed below. They demonstrate an upgrade workflow and link to the upgrade details.

Here are the installation upgrade steps:

1. {.root}[If You're Upgrading to Liferay Portal 6.2, Follow the Liferay Portal 6.2 Upgrade Instructions First](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017903232-Upgrading-Liferay){.title}

2. [If You're Upgrading a Sharded Environment, Follow the Instructions for Upgrading It](../04-upgrading-liferay/97-upgrading-a-sharded-environment.md){.title}

    Upgrading a sharded installation (installation prior to DXP 7.2) requires migrating it to as many non-sharded Liferay installations (servers) as you have shards.{.summary}

3. [If You're a Upgrading a Cluster, Read Those Instructions First](../10-maintaining-clustered-installations/01-maintaining-clustered-installations.md){.title}

    If you're upgrading a cluster, read the cluster update instructions first and apply them to your upgrade.{.summary}

4. [Plan for Handling the Deprecated Applications](../04-upgrading-liferay/98-deprecations-in-liferay-dxp-7-2.md){.title}

    Every application deprecation has different ramifications. Learn how the deprecations might affect your sites and decide how to replace the functionality you use from those applications.{.summary}

5. Prune a Database Backup{.title}

    Here you'll prune a backup copy of your database and test it with a copy of your existing version of DXP/Portal. The notes and scripts you assemble as you prune the database are invaluable for pruning your production database.{.summary}

    1. Copy Your Existing Production Installation to a Test Server{.title}

        Prepare a test server to use a copy of your production installation. Your test server must use the same Liferay version you're currently using on production. Configure your server to use a new empty database for testing data upgrades.{.summary}

    2. [Copy the Production Database Backup](../09-maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/02-backing-up.md){.title}

        Import data from your production database backup to the new empty database. **Important:** Make sure to save the data import log---you'll examine it in the next steps.{.summary}

    3. [Prune the Test Database](../04-upgrading-liferay/03-pruning-the-database.md){.title}

        You may have intermediate versions of objects (e.g., `JournalArticle` objects) that you don't need. Remove them and objects that only reference them.{.summary}

    4. Back up the Pruned Database so You Can Revert to it if Needed{.title}

    5. [Test Liferay with its Pruned Database Copy](../04-upgrading-liferay/03-pruning-the-database.md#test-with-a-copy-of-the-pruned-database){.title}

        Make sure Liferay continues to work successfully. If it's broken, start over with a fresh database backup and prune it more carefully.{.summary}

    6. Checkpoint: You've successfully pruned your test server data. You're read to upgrade that data.

6. Prepare a New Server for Testing the Upgrade{.title}

    Set up a test server with the new DXP version, configured to use your document repository and DXP database. You'll migrate your portal and system properties too. (Note, this step can be done in parallel with pruning your database.){.summary}

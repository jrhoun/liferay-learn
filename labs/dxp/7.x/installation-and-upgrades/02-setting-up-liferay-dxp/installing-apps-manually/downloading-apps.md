# Downloading Apps

If you purchase an app via the [Liferay Marketplace website](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace), you can download the app via its receipt or your account. Each Marketplace app is distributed as an LPKG package (`.lpkg` file). The LPKG contains Marketplace metadata and the files the app needs to run.

The quickest, most convenient way to download an app is via its receipt.

### Downloading via the Purchase Receipt

An app's receipt displays immediately on purchasing the app.

Here's how to download the app from its receipt:

1. In the receipt, click *See Purchased*. The *Purchased App* page for that app appears.

1. Click *App* to download the app.

The LPKG file downloads to your machine.

```note::
   The receipt Liferay emails you links to the receipt too.
```

If you don't happen to download the app via the receipt, there's no need to worry. Your purchased apps are available to download via the Marketplace website and your Liferay.com account page. 

### Downloading via the Purchased Apps Page 

The *Purchased Apps* page lets you download your purchased apps any time. It shows the apps you purchased, organized by project.

Here are the steps for using the Purchased Apps page:

1. Navigate to the Purchased Apps page via the Marketplace website or liferay.com. 

    **Marketplace website:** Go to https://web.liferay.com/marketplace and sign in. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select *Purchased Apps*. 

    **Liferay.com:** Go to [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com) and sign in. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner, select *Account Home* from the menu, and select *Apps* in the navigation panel on the left.

    A *Liferay project* is a space where teammates share apps they have purchased or developed. If you have the necessary permissions, you can also create a new project for your company.

1. Click a app's icon. A listing for the purchased app version appears. 

    ![Figure 3: The app's page provides an App link for downloading the current app version and a Past Versions link for viewing older versions of the app.](./downloading-apps/images/03.png)

1. If you're interested in an earlier version of the app, click on *Past Versions*. (Optional)

1. Click *App* for the app version you want to download.

The app downloads as an LPKG file. You can [install the app](./app-installation-strategies.md) via the this file.

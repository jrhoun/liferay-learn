# Activating Liferay DXP

Liferay DXP is activated using an XML file (`.xml`) called an activation key.  It specifies your DXP subscription terms or trial agreement. When you [run Liferay DXP for the first time](../installing-liferay-dxp-on-premises/running-liferay-dxp-for-the-first-time.md), the license page appears and requests an activation key.

### Deploying a Key 

If you have a DXP activation key file, copy it to the `deploy` folder in your [Liferay Home](../14-reference/01-liferay-home.md).

A message in the DXP console confirms the registration.

```
License registered ...
```

DXP is ready to use.

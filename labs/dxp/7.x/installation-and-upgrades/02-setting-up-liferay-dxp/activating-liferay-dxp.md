# Activating Liferay DXP

Liferay DXP must be activated using an activation key or Liferay Connected Services (LCS). When you [run Liferay DXP for the first time](../installing-liferay-dxp-on-premises/running-liferay-dxp-for-the-first-time.md), the license page appears. The page mentions two ways of activating DXP:

1. Activation key
2. Liferay Connected Services

## Activation Key

An activation key is an XML file that enables Liferay DXP based on your subscription or DXP trial agreement.

### Applying a Key 

If you have a DXP activation key XML file, copy it to the `deploy` folder in your [Liferay Home](../14-reference/01-liferay-home.md).

A message in the DXP console confirms the registration.

```
License registered ...
```

When you refresh the page, the Liferay DXP home page appears.

[Activation Keys](https://customer.liferay.com/activation-key) page to download an activation key or to request one.

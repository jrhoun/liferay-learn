# Using the Liferay Marketplace 

Liferay Marketplace is a hub for sharing, browsing, and downloading apps. Marketplace leverages the entire Liferay ecosystem to release and share apps in a user-friendly, one-stop shop.

The easiest way to use the Marketplace is from the Control Panel.

```important::
   In production-grade environments, do not purchase apps in Marketplace via the Control Panel---only purchase apps via the [Marketplace website](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace). The Marketplace user experience on the website and in the Control Panel is the same. The only difference is that purchasing in the Control Panel installs the app immediately, while purchasing on the website leaves the app uninstalled but available in your purchased app screen.

   When you purchase an app using the Marketplace website, the app is available for [downloading](./installing-apps-manually/downloading-apps.md) and [installing manually](./installing-apps-manually/installing-apps-in-production.md).
```

The Marketplace plugin makes the Marketplace available in the Control Panel. The plugin is built-in to the DXP Tomcat Bundle but it can be installed to DXP installations on application servers too. If you're using a Tomcat Bundle skip the next section. 

## Installing the Marketplace Plugin

If you installed DXP on an application server, you must install the Marketplace plugin to access the Marketplace via the Control Panel.

1. Download the [Marketplace plugin](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/download).

2. Deploy the plugin (`.lpkg` file) by copying it to the `deploy` folder in [Liferay Home](../14-reference/01-liferay-home.md) or installing it using the [App Manager](./installing-apps-manually/managing-apps.md).

The Marketplace is available to use in the Control Panel (next)

## Visiting the Marketplace

Here's how to enter the Marketplace from within DXP:

1. In the Control Panel, navigate to *Apps* &rarr; *Store*.

1. Sign in with your liferay.com account.

``` important::
   Purchasing apps requires that you have a [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com) account and agree to the Marketplace Terms of Use.
```

The Marketplace appears. It's time to check out some apps.

## Browsing Apps

Marketplace provides a familiar app store experience. Apps are in the center of the page, in the following sections:

- *Featured Apps:* Liferay features a different set of apps each month.

- *New and Interesting:* The latest apps added to Marketplace.

- *Most Viewed in the Past Month:* The top 5 most viewed apps in the last month.

- *Liferay Subscription Apps:* Apps available to enterprise subscribers only.

- *Templates and Themes:* Apps for organizing site content and changing your site's look and feel.

- And app categories: *Communication*, *Productivity*, *Security*, and more.

Each section's *See All* link lists all the apps for that section.

![Figure 2: Each app category page, such as the Communication app page, lists the apps published to that category.](./using-the-liferay-marketplace/images/02.png)

# Documents and Media Configuration with Clustering

When Liferay DXP is clustered, Documents and Media must use the same [document repository configuration](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028810112-Document-Repository-Configuration) on all nodes.

For example, if you are using the Advanced File System store for your document repository, then you may have this line in your `portal-ext.properties` file for your DXP instance:

```properties
dl.store.impl=com.liferay.portal.store.file.system.AdvancedFileSystemStore
```

You would then need to copy this line to the `portal-ext.properties` file for all nodes to be able to share documents between them.

Note that if you are using the File System or Advanced File System stores, the file system must be accessible from all nodes (i.e., a network share), support concurrent requests, and file locking.

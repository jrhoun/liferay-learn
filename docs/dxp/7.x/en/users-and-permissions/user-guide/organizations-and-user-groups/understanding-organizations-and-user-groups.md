# Understanding Organizations and User Groups

<!-- https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-nested-groups-938847047.html for reference to try and simplify this down. This jira article seemed the closest feature analog (it's definitely not the same) that tries to do a similar thing. This is my attempt at an opening paragraph: -->

Organizations are groups of users that can be arranged in a hierarchical fashion. Organizations can be comprised of sub-organizations that inherit the roles and permissions assigned to them. This allows for distributed and delegated management for groups and their related sub-groups. This arrangement can simplify administration of large groups of users. Organizations and sub-Organization hierarchies can nest as much as needed.

## Organizations Compared to User Groups

<!-- this is very imperfect...but if we can get this right it might be helpful. If we can't - we can just remove it for now. -->

| Criteria | Organizations | User Groups |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Many users distributed into smaller sub-groups |  | x | x |
| Roles and permissions inheritance and scoped to specific groups |  | x |  |
| Sites easily created and scoped for each sub-group |  | x |  |
| Hierarchical delegation of user administration across multiple sub-groups |  | x |  |

# Organization Sites

Coming soon!

<!-- Organizations and each child organization can be configured to have its own attached Site. See article [x]() to enable this functionality.

Organization sites allow groups to create nested hierarchical sites with content created, administered, and tailored specifically to each organizational unit's needs. Organization administrators are treated as the Site administrators: they can manage the pages, widgets, and content of the Site as well as the Users of the Organization. Members of an Organization with an attached Site are treated as members of the Organization's Site. This means that they can access the private pages of the Organization's Site, along with any widgets or content there. Attaching Sites to Organizations allows portal administrators to use Organizations to facilitate distributed portal administration, not just distributed User administration. -->

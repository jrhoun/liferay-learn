User Groups can be used to manage Site membership. When you assign a User Group to a Site, the group's Users become members of that Site. This is one of the main use cases for User Groups. 

Follow these steps to assign a User Group to a Site:

1. Open the Menu (![Menu](../../images/icon-menu.png)), select the Site you want to work in, then open its Site Administration menu. 

1. In the Site Administration menu, select *People* &rarr; *Memberships*.  This opens the Site Memberships screen. 

   ![Select Memberships from the People menu.](./creating-and-managing-user-groups/images/site-memberships.png)

1. In Memberships, select the *User Groups* tab. This tab displays any User Groups currently assigned to the Site. 

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)), select any User Groups you want to assign to the Site, then click *Done*.  The User Groups you selected now appear in the User Groups tab.

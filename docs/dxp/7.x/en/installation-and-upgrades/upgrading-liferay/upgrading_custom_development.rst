Custom code updates to 7.3 are done the same way as updates to 7.2. The `Liferay Upgrade Planner <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner>`__ is still the recommended way to upgrade custom development. It identifies your code that's affected by `7.3 Breaking Changes <../../../liferay-internals/reference/7-3-breaking-changes.md>`__ and offers to automatically adapt your code to many of the changes.

Upgrade your custom development now using the `Liferay Upgrade Planner <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner>`__ and see `Upgrading Code to Liferay 7.2 <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029316391-Introduction-to-Upgrading-Code-to-Liferay-DXP-7-2>`__ for more information.

# Navigating DXP

Liferay DXP's out-of-the-box navigation is organized into two major areas: the _Personal Menu_ and the _Product Menu_.

## Personal Menu

The Personal Menu is the hub for information and activities for a User that is logged in.

Users can use the personal menu to:

* [Change account information](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#changing-account-information) (Name, Password, etc.)
* [See what sites they are members of](../site-building/building-sites/adding-members-to-sites.md)
* [Review site notifications](../collaboration-and-social/notifications-and-requests/user-guide/managing-notifications-and-requests.md)
* [Sign out](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#signing-out)
* And more...

## Product Menu

The DXP _Product Menu_ contains the _Applications Menu_ and the _Control Panel_. Click the _Applications Menu_ icon (![Applications Menu icon](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) at the top of the screen to access it.

```note::
   By default, Users with the *Guest* or *User* roles are not be able to access the Product Menu.
```

You can also navigate to other Sites available to you from either the _Applications_ or _Control Panel_ tabs in the _Product Menu_.

### Applications Menu

The _Applications Menu_ contains a variety of links to manage many different applications within your Liferay DXP server.

## Site Menu

The DXP _Site Menu_ on the left side of the screen contains actions, content, and configurations that are scoped to the specific site that is being currently viewed.

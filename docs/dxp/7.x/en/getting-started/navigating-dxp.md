# Navigating DXP

Liferay DXP's out-of-the-box navigation is organized into two major areas: the _Personal Menu_ and the _Product Menu_.

## Personal Menu

The Personal Menu is the hub for information and activities for a user that is logged in.

Users can use the personal menu to:

* [Change account information](../user-and-system-management/README.md) (Name, Password, etc.)
* [See what sites they are members of](../site-building/01-building-sites/05-adding-members-to-sites.md)
* [Review site notifications](../collaboration-and-social/05-notifications-and-requests/README.md)
* [Sign out](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#signing-out)
* And more...

## Product Menu

The DXP Product menu contains the _Control Panel_ and the _Site Menu_.

> **Note:** By default, users with the _Guest_ or _User_ roles are not be able to access the Product Menu.

### Control Panel

The _Control Panel_ contains general administrative actions and configurations that apply _globally_ to the Liferay DXP installation.

### Site Menu

The DXP _Site Menu_ drop down contains actions, content, and configurations that are scoped to the specific site that is being currently viewed.

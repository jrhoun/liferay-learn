# Introduction to the Admin Account

The Admin user is created by default in any new installation of Liferay DXP and has full permissions to modify every facet of a Liferay DXP instance. The Admin user can create, modify, and delete Sites, Users, pages, and perform all Site administrative tasks.

## Accessing Liferay DXP as the Admin User

1. Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
1. Click the _Sign In_ link. <!-- Screenshot must be updated to latest 7.2 DXP -->

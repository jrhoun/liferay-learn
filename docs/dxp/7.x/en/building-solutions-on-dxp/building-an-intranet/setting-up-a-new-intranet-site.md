# Setting Up a New Intranet Site

<!-- Statement about the role of the intranet website. -->
Your intranet's Site serves as the center piece of your users' portal experience, whether they're accessing it via desktop, tablet, or smart phone.

<!-- Statement about the importance of having focused Sites and the choices that are available with Liferay DXP. -->
When creating a Site with Liferay DXP, you can create standalone Sites, or create related Sites in a hierarchy. You can also create Organization Sites, as well as sub-organizations and Sites.

This tutorial uses Organization Site.

## Creating an Organization Site

Liferay DXP [Organizations]() are used to enable distributed User management. They provide a convenient way to organize and manage users and roles within your intranet, to reflect the real-world hierarchy of your organization. Once created, you can enable a Site for your organization. This Site uses your organization's configurations.

To create an Organization, open the control panel, and go to *Users and Organizations*; Go to the *Organizations* tab, and click on the *Add* button; set name, and optionally set a central country and region for the organization. Click on *Save*. You can then access Organization Site settings.

Enable Site. This creates a new blank Site using the *Blank* template. By default, it's name is the same as the organization, though you can cName matches. You access these setting and enable a Site for an organization at any time by clicking on the organization's *Actions* button and selecting *Edit*. See [Understanding Organizations]() for more information about configuration options.). <!--Why is this under 'edit'? Not where I would look... -->

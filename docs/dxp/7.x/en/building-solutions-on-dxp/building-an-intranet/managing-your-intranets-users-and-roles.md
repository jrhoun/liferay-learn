# Managing Your Intranet's Users and Roles

[Permissions] determine access and functionalities available to users. [Roles]() group permissions to standardize user __. To easily assign common permissions to similar users, create [User Groups]() that correspond to specific intranet responsibilities in your organization, then create correlating intranet roles with permissions that enable them to fulfill their responsibilities, and associate/assign each role to its User Group. In this way you can quickly assign permissions to users so that your intranet reflects your organizational structure.

When defining roles, ensure they have the desired scope (e.g., instance, Site, Organization, Asset Library).

| Intranet User Profile                 | Default User Role | Corresponding Permissions |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Employee (e.g., full-time, part-time) |                  |                          |
| Manager (e.g., HR, Events, Project)   |                  |                          |
| Content Creator                       |                  |                          |
| Site Designer                         |                  |                          |
| Content Manager                       |                  |                          |

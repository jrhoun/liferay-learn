# Reviewing Assets

When an asset's workflow has been [activated](./activating-workflow.md), one or more user has to review it before publication. Depending on how your workflow is built, you could have the review process assigned to a specific User or a Role (Portal or Site Content Reviewer). In the latter case, anyone assigned to that Role may approve or reject the submission. For example, if you are using the out-of-the-box _Single Approver_ process, the workflow tasks are assigned to a Portal or Site Content Reviewer or anyone with administrator rights.

Once an asset has been submitted, the _Workflow_ application fires a notification to all the potential reviewers who have been assigned to that Role. To access notifications, click your avatar and select _Notifications_.

## Reviewing an Asset

Because the _Single Approver_ workflow process is assigned tasks to Roles, you have to assign the task to yourself or another user first.

### Assigning the Task

1. Click your avatar and select _My Workflow Tasks_.
1. All workflow tasks assigned directly to a user are listed in the My Workflow Task widget's _Assigned to Me_ tab.

1. To claim a task, click the _Assigned to My Roles_ tab.

1. Click the asset's _Actions_ button (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select _Assign to Me_.

1. Click the name of the asset to review the asset. Here, there is a preview of the asset (a _Wiki Page_) and the review status.

1. To advance the review process, assign to the task to Self or to another user with review rights. Click the Asset's _Actions_ button (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) then _Assign to Me_.
1. Enter an optional comment in the _Comment_ text field.
1. Click _Done_.

### Approving or Rejecting the Task

The fastest way to approve or reject an asset is from the _Review: xxxx_ tab.

![Approve or reject a task.](./reviewing-assets/images/07.png)

1. Click the _Actions_ button (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select _Approve_ or _Reject_.
1. Enter an optional comment and click _Done_.

Once a task is complete, it is moved to the _Completed_ section on the _Assigned to Me_ tab.

The approved asset (the _Wiki _Page_) is now published in the widget.

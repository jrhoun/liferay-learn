# Enabling CAPTCHA on Form Submissions

[CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) can be enabled to deter automated form submissions.

To enable CAPTCHA:

1. Click the form's _Options_ button (![Options](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select _Settings_.

1. Switch the _Require CAPTCHA_ toggle to the right.

    ![Enable CAPTCHA](./enabling-captcha-on-form-submissions/images/02.png)

1. Click _Done_.

Form submissions now require the completion of a CAPTCHA check.

## Additional Information

By default, Liferay uses a "Simple CAPTCHA" check. This can be configured and changed to use an alternative CAPTCHA engine, like Google's reCAPTCHA service. For more information on how to do this, see [Authentication Basics](../../../installation-and-upgrades/securing-liferay/authentication-basics.md#configuring-captcha-or-recaptcha).

## Viewing Translated Forms

If an authenticated user accesses the form and a translation is available in the user’s language, the user sees the translated form by default.

If accessed in the [Form widget on a Liferay DXP page](../sharing-forms.md), the Form is displayed in the User’s language automatically. If there’s no translation available for the User’s language, the default language of the Form is displayed.

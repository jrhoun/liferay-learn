# Redirecting Users on Form Submission

By default, when a user submits a form response, they are directed to a [success page](../creating-forms.md#adding-a-success-page). This behavior can be configured to instead redirect a user to a specific URL after submitting a form response.

Follow these steps to set up a redirect URL:

1. Open the form's _Form Settings_ section by clicking the _Options_ button (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)).
1. Click _Settings_.
1. Enter the redirect URL in the _Redirect URL_ field.

1. Click _Done_.

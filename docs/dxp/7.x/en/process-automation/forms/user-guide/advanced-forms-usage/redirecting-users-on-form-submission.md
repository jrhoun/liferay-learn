# Redirecting Users on Form Submission

An alternative to a [success page](../creating-forms.md#adding-a-success-page) is to redirect the user to a specific URL after they have submitted their form.

Follow these steps to set up a redirect URL:

1. Open the form's _Form Settings_ section by clicking the *Options* button (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)).
1. Click _Settings_.
1. Enter the redirect URL in the _Redirect URL_ field.

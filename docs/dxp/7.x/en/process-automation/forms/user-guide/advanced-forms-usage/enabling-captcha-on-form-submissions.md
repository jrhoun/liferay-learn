# Enabling Captcha on Form Submissions

A [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) is a visual device that ensures that a human being, rather than a computer, is interacting with the site. Once CAPTCHA is enabled, it prevents a bot from submitting forms.

To enable CAPTCHA:

1. Click the form's _Options_ button (![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) and select _Settings_.

1. Slide the _Require CAPTCHA_ toggle to the right.

1. Click _Done_.

Once CAPTCHA has been enabled, this form has protection against bot submissions.

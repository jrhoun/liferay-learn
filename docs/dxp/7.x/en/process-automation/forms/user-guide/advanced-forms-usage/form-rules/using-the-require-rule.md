# Using the Require Rule

Use a require rule to make a field required based on one or more conditions.

## Prerequisites



To configure a require rule,

 1. Edit the [Show Rule](./using-the-show-hide-rule.md) configured above. Open the Rules tab of the Edit Form page.
 1. Click the Actions (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the rule
  Click *Edit*.
Add an Action to the rule:
      - If the *I am 18 years old or older* field is equal to *No*, show the *Legal Guardian Email Address* field and make it required.

      - Save the rule.

     ![Figure 2: Once a rule is saved, it is displayed so that you can easily understand what it does.](../../../images/forms-require-rule2.png)

Require rules let you require fields based on input from other fields.

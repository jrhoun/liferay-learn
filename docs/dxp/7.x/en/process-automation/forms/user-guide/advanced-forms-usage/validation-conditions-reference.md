# Validation Conditions Reference

There are several out-of-the-box validation conditions that can be used to validate form responses before they are submitted.

## Text Field Validation Conditions

| Condition        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contains         | This condition checks against a specified value permitted; if the entry contains this value, then validation fails.                                                                                                     |
| Does not Contain | This is the opposite of "Contains"; if an entry does _not_ contain the value, validation fails.                                                                                                                         |
| Is not URL       | This condition ensures URLs are valid.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Is not Email     | This condition ensures email addresses are valid.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Does not Match   | This condition ensures [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are valid; for example, this RegEx expression `^[0-9]{10}$` ensures that ten consecutive numeric digits must be entered. |

## Numeric Field Validation Conditions

| Condition                   | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is greater than or equal to | This condition checks whether the value is greater than or equal to the specified value. |
| Is greater than             | This condition checks whether the value is greater than the specified value.             |
| Is not equal to             | This condition checks whether the value is equal to the specified value.                 |
| Is less than or equal to    | This condition checks whether the value is less than or equal to the specified value.    |
| Is less than                | This condition checks whether the value is less than the specified value.                |

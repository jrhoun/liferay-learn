# Installing the Marketplace Plugin

If you installed DXP on an application server, you must install the Marketplace plugin to access the Marketplace via the Control Panel.

``` note::
   If you are using the DXP Tomcat bundle, then the Marketplace plugin is pre-installed in your bundle.
```

Follow these steps to install the Marketplace plugin:

1. Download the [Marketplace plugin](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/download).

2. Deploy the plugin (`.lpkg` file) by copying it to the `deploy` folder in [Liferay Home](../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/liferay-home.md) or installing it using the [App Manager](./using-the-app-manager.md).

The Marketplace is now available to use in the Control Panel.

# Configuring a Virtual Instance: Localization

The Localization category contains the configuration for setting the default instance language and time zone for the virtual instance. You can also configure the Language Selector's look and feel from the Widget Scope. 

To access the Localization settings, Open the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, and select the *Localization* category under the *PLATFORM* section.

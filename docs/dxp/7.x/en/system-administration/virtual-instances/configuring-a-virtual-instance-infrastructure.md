# Configuring a Virtual Instance: Infrastructure

The Instance Settings also contain settings for Infrastructure and Localization, as well as integrations for Analytics and Third Party map APIs. Each configuration entry is described in the corresponding section below. 

The Infrastructure category contains settings to specify which content types are validated during the Import/Export process and whether to delete temporary LAR files during the Import/Export process. 

To access these settings, open the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings* and select *Infrastructure* under the PLATFORM heading.

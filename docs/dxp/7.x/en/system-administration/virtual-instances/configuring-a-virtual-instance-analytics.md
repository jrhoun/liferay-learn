# Configuring a Virtual Instance: Analytics

The Analytics category defines the available analytics systems for the virtual instance. Enter an analytics system or remove one of the two pre-configured options (`google` and `piwik`). Activate these systems here, and configure them at the [site level](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/advanced-site-settings#analytics). 

SCREENSHOT

To access Analytics configuration settings, open the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, and select the *Analytics* category under the *PLATFORM* section.

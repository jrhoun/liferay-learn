# Getting Started with Blogs

The Blogs application's editor has a complete set of WYSIWYG controls that appear when and where you need them. You can also switch to source mode to edit your content's HTML code.

The Blogs application contains a powerful set of tools for customizing how your blogs appear. For example, display templates like Abstract or Full Content let you choose how much of a blog post appears on a page. You can leverage the built-in display templates or create your own. You can also add a cover image to each of your blog entries.

The fastest way to begin using the _Blogs_ app is to deploy the widget to a [Site Page](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360029132211-Creating-Pages).

1. Navigate to the site and page desired (e.g. _Community Blog_).
1. Click the _Add_ button.
1. Click _Widgets_ then _Collaboration_ to expand the menu.

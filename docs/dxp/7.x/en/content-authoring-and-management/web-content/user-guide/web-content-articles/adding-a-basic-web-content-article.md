# Adding a Basic Web Content Article

Web content is one of the most practical and essential methods for creating site content in DXP. Web content articles can be displayed through widgets on pages, or on special [display pages](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029133291-Creating-Display-Page-Templates) designed specifically to display the content.

All web content articles are based on a structure that defines the fields available to it. <!-- TODO: See the [Introduction to Web Content Structures](../web-content-structures/introduction-to-web-content-structures.md) for more information.--> DXP provides one default structure out-of-the-box, _Basic Web Content._ The steps below will use this default structure.

## Managing Permissions for Translation

To manually translate web content, Users must have either Update permissions for the specific content, or Translate permissions for one or more languages.

### Assigning Update Permissions

Update permissions are content specific and must be assigned individually. Users with *Update* permissions for web content can manually translate it into any available language. They can also export web content for translation and import finished translations of the content.

Follow these steps to assign Update permissions for web content:

1. Open the *Product* menu, and go to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Web Content*.

1. Click on the *Actions* menu ( ![Actions Button ](../../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the content you want to configure, and select *Permissions*.

1. Use the checkboxes to assign Update permissions to the desired User roles.

   Alternatively, you can assign permissions during content creation. Simply go to *Permissions* in the content Properties sidebar, and assign the desired permissions to specific User roles.

### Assigning Translate Permissions

Translate permissions are language specific and grant access to the *Translate* action for web content. Users with Translate permissions can manually translate any Site content into the languages for which they have permission. Once granted, Translate permissions cannot be restricted to particular content.

Follow these steps to assign Translate permissions for specific languages:

1. Open the Control Panel, and go to *Users* &rarr; *Roles*.

1. Click on the *Actions* menu ( ![Actions button](../../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the role you want to assign Translate permissions, and select *Edit*.

   Alternatively, you can create a new role by clicking on the Add button ( ![Add button](../../../images/icon-add.png) ).

1. Click on the *Define Permissions* tab, and go to *Site and Asset Library Administration* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Translation* in the Permissions sidebar menu.

1. Use the checkboxes to assign the desired language permissions to the selected role.

   ![Assign the desired language permissions to the selected role.](./manually-translating-web-content/images/01.png)

1. Click *Save* at the bottom of the page.

Users with the configured role can now manually translate any web content into the specified languages.

## Translating Web Content in DXP

Follow these steps to manually translate web content in DXP:

1. Open the *Product* menu, and go to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Web Content*.

1. Click on the *Actions* menu ( ![Actions Button ](../../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the content you want to translate, and select *Translate*.

   This redirects you to DXP's content translation interface, where you can view the content's original text alongside your translation. The left column displays the language you're translating from, while the right column provides editable fields you can use for your translation.

   ![Selecting translate redirects you to DXP's content translation interface.](./manually-translating-web-content/images/02.png)

1. Use the language flags in the top left corner to determine the language your translating from as well as the language into which you want to translate.

   Users with content Update permissions can translate the original text into any language.

   Users with translate permissions can only translate the origin text into languages for which they have permission.

1. Enter your translation into the *Title*, *Description*, and *Content* fields.

1. Click *Publish* to create a new version of the web content or initiate a workflow, depending on your configuration.

   Alternatively, click *Save as Draft* to save and publish your translation at a later time.

## Integrating Translation with Custom Workflows

With DXP, you can integrate the translation process with custom workflows so your published translations go through a defined review and approval process.

Follow these steps to enable a custom workflow for translation:

1. Open the *Product* menu, and go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Workflow*.

1. Click on the workflow dropdown menu for *Translation*, and select the desired workflow.

1. Click *Save*.

![Click on the workflow dropdown menu for Translation, and select the desired workflow.](./manually-translating-web-content/images/03.png)

Once workflow is enabled, each published translation is listed as an individual task and must be approved before the web content is officially updated. Those reviewing translations are provided with a read-only, side-by-side preview of the content's original and translated texts.

If edits are required, return to the web content translation page for article in review. When you have finished updating the your translation, resubmit it for further review.

If your translation is approved, your changes are applied to the web content as with regular updates to web content. When applied, the changes cannot be reverted automatically. See [Introduction to Workflow](../../../process-automation/workflow/user-guide/introduction-to-workflow.md) for more information about building and using workflows.

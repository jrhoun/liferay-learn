# About the Content Dashboard

> Available: Liferay 7.3+.

The Content Dashboard is a global application for managing your content in Liferay DXP. From the Content Dashboard page, content authors and marketers can access all the content generated across the sites in the Liferay DXP instance, audit this content in the [Content Audit Tool](./content-dashboard-interface.md#the-content-audit-tool), or analyze content performance using the [Performance sidebar](./content-dashboard-interface.md#the-content-performance-sidebar).

Using the Content Dashboard, content authors and marketers can analyze their content in different ways:

- Filter and find content, using built-in or custom filters.
- Using global Vocabularies, analyze the existing content for each audience or phase in the customer journey.
- Audit the content areas with enough content or content gaps to improve the content strategy.
- Gather content performance information, like traffic sources, or the number of views and reads along the time. 

The Content Dashboard shows information based on the Vocabularies and Categories you assign to the content assets. Liferay provides the *Content* and *Stage* global Vocabularies to work along with the Content Dashboard. To learn about Vocabularies and Categories, see [Organizing Content with Categories and Tags](../tags-and-categories/user-guide/organizing-content-with-categories-and-tags.md). To assign categories to your content, see [Defining Categories and Vocabularies for Content](../tags-and-categories/user-guide/defining-categories-and-vocabularies-for-content.md).

The [Content Audit Tool](./content-dashboard-interface.md#the-content-audit-tool) (1) is the graphical area at the top of the page, showing metrics for the Vocabularies you define in Liferay DXP. You can include and combine your Vocabularies here, and filter the Categories to analyze your data in different ways.

The [Content List area](./content-dashboard-interface.md#the-content-list-area) (2) shows details about your content. From here, you can sort and filter your information using built-in or custom filters. The Content Audit Tool chart changes dynamically based on the filters that you set.

From the Content List area, you can access the [Information](./content-dashboard-interface.md#the-information-sidebar) and [Content Performance](content-dashboard-interface.md#the-performance-sidebar) sidebars (3). The Information sidebar panel provides different metadata for each asset, while the Content Performance sidebar panel gathers statistics for your content, like the number of reads and views.

To learn more about the Content Dashboard interface and how to customize the information presented, see the [Content Dashboard Interface](./content-dashboard-interface.md) topic.

## Auditing your Content with the Content Dashboard

Using the Content Performance panel in the Content Dashboard, content teams can periodically assess the content strategy execution and adapt this strategy base on quantitative data.

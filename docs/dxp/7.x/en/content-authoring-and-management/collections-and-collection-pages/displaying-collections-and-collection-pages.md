# Displaying Collections

You can display a Collection using a Collection Page or a Collection Display Fragment. For more information about these display options, see [About Collections and Collection Pages](./about-collections-and-collection-pages.md#displaying-collections).

By default, a Collection displays all its items. However, you can create *Personalized Variations* of these items using Segments. For more information, see [Customizing Collections Using Segments](./customizing-collections-using-segments.md).

```note::
   Before displaying a Collection, you must create one. For more information, see [Creating Collections](./creating-collections.md).
```

# Introduction to the Recycle Bin

Liferay DXP's Recycle Bin application allows users to temporarily delete an asset and place it in the Recycle Bin. Once in the Recycle Bin, the content is now temporarily stored there and users can later restore the content to its original state. Recycled items can expire after a certain period of time which results in their permanent deletion. By default, Recycle Bin is enabled across the DXP instance and can be disabled on a site by site basis.

With the Recycle Bin enabled, the _Move to the Recycle Bin_ action replaces _Delete_ for certain asset types.

Inside the Recycle Bin, users can restore or delete an asset.

If the Recycle Bin is disabled on a site, all assets are automatically deleted.

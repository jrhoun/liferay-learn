# Introduction to the Recycle Bin

Liferay DXP includes an integrated *Recycle Bin* so you can temporarily store content and data you want to remove from your instance before making that removal permanent. By default, the Recycle Bin is enabled instance-wide, though you can disable it at any time for individual Sites.

While enabled, the *Delete* action is replaced with *Move to the Recycle Bin* for recyclable assets (i.e., folders, web content, blogs, documents, media, message boards, and wikis).

Once recycled, an asset is retained for a specified period of time, during which Users can *Restore* or permanently *Delete* it. However, once an asset has remained in the recycle bin for longer than the specified retention period, it is automatically deleted from your instance. The default retention period is 43,200 minutes (i.e., 30 days).

If the Recycle Bin is disabled on a site, assets that are deleted are permanently deleted and cannot be restored.

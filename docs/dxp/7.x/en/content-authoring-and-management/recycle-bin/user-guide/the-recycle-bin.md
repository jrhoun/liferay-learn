# The Recycle Bin

An integrated Recycle Bin can temporarily store content and data you want to remove from your instance before making that removal permanent. By default, the Recycle Bin is enabled instance-wide, but you can disable it at any time for individual Sites.

While enabled, the Delete action is replaced with *Move to the Recycle Bin* for recyclable assets (i.e., folders, web content, blogs, bookmarks, documents, media, message boards, and wikis).

Once recycled, assets are retained for a specified period of time, during which Users can restore or permanently delete them. When an asset has remained in the Recycle Bin for longer than the specified retention period, it is automatically deleted from your instance. The default retention period is 43,200 minutes (i.e., 30 days).

If the Recycle Bin is disabled on a Site, deleted assets are permanently deleted and cannot be restored.

# Defining Categories and Vocabularies for Content

Using Categories, you can group similar assets and better organize your site content. Along with Tags, Categories help you and your users to find relevant information through search or navigation. For more information about Tags and Categories in Liferay DXP and the different usage scenarios, see [Organizing Content with Categories and Tags](organizing-content-with-categories-and-tags.md).

You can add properties to categories, to provide additional information about the category. You can think of category properties as tags for you categories.

## Vocabularies Visibility

When you create a new Vocabulary, you define its Visibility. Categories can be *Public* or *Internal*, depending of the Category Visibility. When .

This Visibility option can be useful when you need to separate internal and external categorization. For example, your Marketing department may want to create Internal categories for describing and organizing web content according to an specific audience, without exposing these categories to consumers. At the same time, you may want to use Public categories to provide users more relevant search results in your website.

| Public Vocabulary | Internal Vocabulary |
| --- | --- |
| Visible in Pages, Widgets, Fragments, and Searches | Only visible for administrators |
| 

```note::
   Vocabularies from previous Liferay versions are configured with Public visibility.
```

Internal Vocabularies show a *Hidden* icon [Hidden](icon-hidden.png) next to their name.

## Default Vocabularies

You can find two new vocabularies by default: Audience and Stage. Content Authors, Content Strategist, and Marketers can use these vocabularies along with the Content Dashboard []() to define and review their content strategy, and audit the content. These default vocabularies 

These new vocabularies, along with the new (((Content Dashboard))) [link?] provide answers to the most common questions:

- Determine content areas with enough content as well as content gaps.

# Defining Categories and Vocabularies for Content

Along with Tags, Categories are another instance-wide mechanism for describing your content. Both categories and tags serve a common purpose, helping users to find the information they need. However, there are some important differences between categories and tags:

| Categories | Tags |
| --- | --- |
| Only available for administrators | Available for administrators and non-administrators |
| Grouped in vocabularies | Cannot be grouped |
| Hierarchical categorization | Non-hierarchical categorization |
| Can be 

You can add properties to categories, to provide additional information about the category. You can think of category properties as tags for you categories.

Categories Visibility

When you create a new Category, you define its Visibility. Categories can be *Public* or *Internal*, depending of the Category Visibility. When .

This Visibility option can be useful when you need to separate internal and external categorization. For example, your Marketing department may want to create Internal categories for describing and organizing web content, without exposing these categories to consumers. At the same time, you may want to use Public categories to provide a more relevant search results in your website.

| Public Vocabulary | Internal Vocabulary |
| --- | --- |
| Visible in Pages, Widgets, Fragments, and Searches | Only visible for administrators |
| 

```note::
   Vocabularies from previous Liferay versions are configured with Public visibility.
```

Internal Vocabularies show a *Hidden* icon [Hidden](icon-hidden.png) next to their name.

You can find two new vocabularies by default: Audience and Stage. Content Authors, Content Strategist, and Marketers can use these vocabularies as a starting point to define their content strategy. These new vocabularies, along with the new (((Content Dashboard))) [link?] provide answers to the most common questions:

- Determine content areas with enough content as well as content gaps.
- Audit content.
- Insights to create or adapt the content strategy.

```note::
   In previous Liferay versions, the *Topic* vocabulary was created for each site. The *Topic* vocabulary is now created at the Global Site.
```

# Tagging Content

Tags are keywords that you can assign to content, to help you organizing your information and users to find relevant information. Tags are all-lowercase words or sentences that the content creator can attach to any content. The content creator chooses tags personally, with no predefined categorization or hierachy. Tagging content makes your search results more accurate and enables you to use tools like the Asset Publisher to display content in an organized fashion on a web page.

```tip::
   If you need to categorize the content in a more hierarchical way, you can use [Categories and Vocabularies](./defining-categories-and-vocabularies-for-content.md)
```

You can tag content in two different ways:

- In the Tags Administration section of your Site menu.
- On the fly, as you create new content


## Tagging Content Using the Tag Administrator Section



## Tagging Content as Content is Created

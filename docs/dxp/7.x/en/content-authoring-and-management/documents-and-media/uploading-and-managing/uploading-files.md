# Uploading Files

Documents and Media provides native storage on your Liferay server for digital assets, whether documents, images, or videos. You can quickly upload any number of files by dragging and dropping them into a Documents and Media folder. Alternatively, you can initiate uploads using the application's *Add* button and manually configure file details prior to upload.

```note::
   Users can also configure Liferay to automatically tag supported assets when uploaded. See `Configuring Asset Auto Tagging <../../tags-and-categories/auto-tagging/configuring-asset-auto-tagging.md>`__ to learn more. 
```

Once uploaded, Users with the requisite permissions can view, edit, download, or share your uploaded files. See the [Documents and Media Permissions Reference](../publishing-and-sharing/managing-document-access/documents-and-media-permissions-reference.md) and [Roles and Permissions](../../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/understanding-roles-and-permissions.md) for more information.

## Quickly Uploading Files

The quickest way to upload one or more files is to drag and drop them into the Documents and Media root folder, or an existing sub-folder.

Follow these steps to upload files to a Site:

1. Open the *Site Menu*, and go to Content & Data &rarr; *Documents and Media*.

1. Drag and drop any number of files into the desired folder. This immediately begins the upload process.

Once a file had finished uploading, you can edit its details at any time by clicking on its *Actions* Button (![Actions Button](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and selecting *Edit*.

   You can also follow these steps to upload files to Documents and Media in an Asset Library. See `Asset Library Content <../../asset-libraries/asset-library-content.md>`__ for more information.
```

## Configuring File Details at Upload

Follow these steps to configure file details at upload:

1. Open the *Site Menu*, and go to Content & Data &rarr; *Documents and Media*.

1. Click on the *Add* button (![Add Button](../../../images/icon-add.png)), and select either *File Upload*, or *Multiple Files Upload*.

   ![Select either File Upload, or Multiple Files Upload](./uploading-files/images/02.png)

1. Drag and drop any number of files into the designated drop-zone, or use the file selector to browse for your files.

1. Once you've selected your files, you can determine their details before upload.

   If you've selected *File Upload*, you can set the file's *Title*, *File Name*, *Description*, *Display Page Template*, *Public Categories*, *Related Assets*, and *Permissions* used for your selected file.

# Asset Libraries Overview

Asset Libraries are virtual spaces where you can create and store reusable assets for your DXP instance. You can create as many of these spaces as needed to group together content for departments, teams, or even individual products and campaigns. Each Library is created at the instance level and can be connected to multiple Sites, so your Users can develop and manage assets in each Library instead of within individual Sites. Supported applications include Web Content, Documents and Media, and Collections.

By organizing their contents into smaller, focused buckets, your teams can more easily access and manage their content in different Site contexts. This structure can lower the risk of editing conflicts and content duplication. You can also integrate a custom workflow to direct the publishing process for each Library's web content.

Asset Libraries work under the same permission management system as other DXP applications. So, you can configure which Users can create or access assets in a Library and determine the channels on which those assets are accessible. By default, there are four main Asset Library roles, equivalent to their site counterparts: Asset Library Owner, Admin, Member, and Content Reviewer. Administrators can create new Asset Library roles for their specific needs.

Use Asset Libraries to improve content collaboration, simplify asset organization, and reduce content duplication across your instance. See [Creating and Managing Asset Libraries](./creating-and-managing-asset-libraries.md) to get started with Asset Libraries.

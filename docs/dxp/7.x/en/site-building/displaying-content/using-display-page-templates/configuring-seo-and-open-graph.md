# Configuring SEO and Open Graph

With *Display Page Templates*, you can create standard formats for displaying different content types, such as *Web Content Articles*, *Documents*, and *Blog Entries*. When configuring a template, you can define SEO and Open Graph fields that are dynamically filled for your displayed content.

To create or configure these settings for an existing Display Page template, go to *Design* &rarr; *Page Templates* in the Product menu, and click on the *Display Page Templates* tab.

Create a new template using the Add button (![Add button](../../../images/icon-add.png)), or edit an existing template by clicking on its *Actions* button (![Actions button](./../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and selecting *Configure*. Here, configuration options are organized into two tabs: *SEO* and *Open Graph*.

## Configuring SEO Settings

Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to the methods used to improve your Page's ranking in a search engine results page (SERP). With Liferay DXP, you can create Display Page templates that dynamically configure your displayed content for SEO.

### HTML Title

The *HTML Title* field defines a Display Page's `<title>` tag. This title is used by search engines to rank your Page and serves as the Page's heading in search engine results. By default, Display Page templates map this field to *Title*, but you can select any other Text field. The recommended length for an HTML title is under 60 characters.

### Description

The *Description* field defines a Display Page's description `<meta>` tag. This description is used by search engines to rank your Page and appears in search engine results as a preview of your Page. By default, Display Page templates map this field to *Description*, but you can select any other Text field. The recommended length for a Page's description is under 155 characters.

### Robots

The *Robots* field configures `robots.txt` rules for a Display Page. These rules provide instructions to search engines and other tools crawling and indexing your Site, either blocking or granting a crawler access to a specified path. You can also localize this field using the *Language Flag*.

### Sitemap

Determine whether to include a Display Page in your `sitemap.xml` file, as well as set its *Priority* and *Change Frequency*. These fields inform search engines whether to crawl and index the Display Page, how it should be prioritized relative to other Site Pages, and how frequently it is updated.

## Configuring Open Graph Settings

[Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) is an internet protocol that standardizes how a Site's metadata is displayed on social networks. With Liferay DXP, you can create Display Page templates that dynamically configure a Page's Open Graph `<meta>` tags.

```note::
   For your displayed content, values defined here override default values defined elsewhere in your Liferay instance.
```

### Title

The *Title* field defines a Display Page's `og:title` property, which determines the title displayed for your content in rich previews. By default, this field is mapped to *Title*, like the HTML title field for SEO. While you can select any other Text field, it's best practice to update SEO and Open Graph titles together.

### Description

The *Description* field defines a Display Page's `og:description` property, which determines the description displayed for your content in rich previews. By default, Display Page templates map this field to *Description*, like the description field for SEO. While you can select any other Text field, it's best practice to update SEO and Open Graph descriptions together.

### Image

The *Image* field defines a Display Page's `og:image` properties, which configures the image displayed for your content in rich previews. In addition to the basic image tag, DXP automatically adds a number of structured properties that determine how your selected image is displayed. The Image field defines the following `<meta>` tags.

```
<meta property="og:image" content="http://example.com/ogp.jpg" />
<meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="https://secure.example.com/ogp.jpg" />
<meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg" />
<meta property="og:image:width" content="400" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="300" />
```

By default, this field is unmapped in Display Page templates. This means the template defaults to the image set at Site level, unless you select a different Image field.

### Image Alt Description

The *Image Alt Description* field defines a Display Page's `og:image:alt` property, which determines the alt text read by screen readers for your displayed content's `og:image` property.

```
<meta property="og:image:alt" content="This is an example." />
```

By default, this field is unmapped in Display Page templates. This means the template defaults to the alt text set at the Site level, unless you select a different Text field.

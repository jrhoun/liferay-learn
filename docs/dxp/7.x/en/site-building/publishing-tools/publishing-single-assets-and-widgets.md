# Publishing Single Assets and Widgets

You can publish single assets and widgets when needed without going through the entire publication process. This is much faster than publishing all content at once.

## Publishing Single Assets

To publish assets in this way, Users must have the following permissions: _Export/Import Application Info_ and _Publish Staging_. See [Managing Staging Permissions](./managing-staging-permissions.md) for more information.

1. Go to _Content & Data_ in the _Product_ menu and select the content or data type you want to publish.

1. Click on the _Actions_ button ( ![Actions button](./../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the asset you want to publish and select _Publish to Live_.

Once you confirm your publication, you're directed to a process page where you can see the status of your publication.

Similar to the standard publication process, single asset publications include associated dependencies: images, custom templates, or folders.

```note::
   Single asset publication is not supported for page-scoped content.
```

## Publishing Single Widgets

Although Staging is typically used to publish content, you can also publish widgets. For example, you can modify a widget's title and publish the change to Live. This is possible because widget configurations are always staged. To publish a widget that is on a Page, you must publish the Page first.

After changing a widget, you can publish the widget by clicking on the _Actions_ button ( ![Actions button](./../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the widget and selecting _Staging_.

# Segmentation

Segmentation provides a way to group a collection of Users into a *User Segment*, based on certain criteria. By using data like User attributes or visitor interactions, you can dynamically target relevant content to your site's users and guests. Once these User Segments are created, you can use them to analyze the selected Users' behaviors and actions or create personalized experiences for them. Segmentation is the first half of the equation; Personalization is the other.

This section focuses on creating and managing User Segments. See the [Personalization section](../02-experience-personalization/personalization-intro.md) for more information on using User Segments to create personalized experiences for your Users.

## Defining Segments

You can create Segments to capture every case. Segments are composed of different criteria. For example, you might have a User Segment for *Free Checking Account Prospects* that contains criteria based on User data, like customers that don't currently have an open checking account; or based on User behavior, like visitors who came to the site through specific channels. To learn more about Segmentation options, see the [overview of the Segment editor](./the-segments-editor.md) and practice [creating Segments](./creating-user-segments.md).

## Integrating Segments with Analytics Cloud

There are two different stories that User Segments can tell:

* Targeting content to specific audiences that encourages engagement and positive user experiences
* The other is defining groups of users and visitors to analyze their behavior and interactions with your site.

To tell the second story, you must integrate with Analytics Cloud.

Analytics Cloud is a Liferay Portal service that provides in-depth information on who uses your site and how they use it. Analytics Cloud is a key component to fully utilizing User Segments and Personalization, since it enables you to see the full picture of how users and visitors on your site behave and interact with both standard and targeted content. You can learn more about this in [Using Analytics Cloud with User Segments](./analytics-cloud-segmentation.md).

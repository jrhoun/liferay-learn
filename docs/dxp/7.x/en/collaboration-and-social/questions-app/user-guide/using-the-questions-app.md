# Using the Questions App

The Questions App is a reimagining of the Message Boards application into a questions and answers format. It still maintains the same elements of Message Boards, but turns the discussions into the creation of questions and answers within customized topics.

You can find the Questions app in the Add menu's Collaboration section.

# Getting Started with the Questions App

The Questions App is a reimagining of the Message Boards application into a questions and answers format. It still maintains the same elements of Message Boards, but turns the discussions into the creation of questions and answers within customized topics.

## Adding a Questions App to a Site

You can find the Questions app in the Add menu's Collaboration section.

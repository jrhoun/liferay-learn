# Subscribing to a Message Board

Subscribing to a message board is a great way to receive notifications about the latest updates. In Liferay DXP, forum members are automatically subscribed on all the threads they created.

To subscribe to a thread or category:

1. On the _Message Boards_ widget (on a site page), click the _Actions_ icon next to a Category or Thread (in this example, _Category 1_)
1. Click _Subscribe_.

The user has now subscribed to _Category 1_. The user will be notified of any changes, such as new threads and subcategories being created under _Category 1_.

To see which categories and threads you have subscribed to:

1. On the _Message Boards_ widget (on a site page), click _My Subscriptions_.

## Subscribing using RSS Feeds

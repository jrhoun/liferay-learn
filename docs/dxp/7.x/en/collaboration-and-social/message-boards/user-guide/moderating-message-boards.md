# Moderating Message Boards

Liferay DXP's _Message Boards_ include features that enable effective day to day administration. This includes thread locking, thread moving and merging, user bans, and thread flagging. See the [Message Boards Permissions Reference](./message-boards-permissions-reference.md) for more information on assigning _Message Boards_ permissions to a role. To learn more about the generic Roles and Permissions, see [Roles and Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360017895212-Roles-and-Permissions).

## Reviewing Flagged Threads

When a thread has been reported for possible abuse, the _Message Boards_ apps uses the _Notifications_ widget to notify the moderator to review the thread. A red number around their icon appears around their profile icon.

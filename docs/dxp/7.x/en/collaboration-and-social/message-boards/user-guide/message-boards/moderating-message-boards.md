# Moderating Message Boards

This article documents the features available for site administrators or moderator roles to facilitate day-to-day thread administration. See the [Message Boards Permissions Reference](./08-message-boards-permissions-reference.md) for more information on assigning _Message Boards_ permissions to a role. To learn more about the generic Roles and Permissions, see [Roles and Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360017895212-Roles-and-Permissions).

Here are some features:

* [Locking Threads](#locking-threads)
* [Moving Threads](#moving-threads)
* [Banning Users](#banning-users)
* [Reviewing Flagged Threads](#reporting-flagged-threads)

## Locking Threads

Site administrators can halt activity on a thread by selecting _Lock_ from the thread's Actions menu. Once a thread is locked, no one can reply to the thread.

To lock a thread:

1. Click (![Actions](./moderating-message-boards/images/07.png)) next to the thread to be locked.
1. Click _Lock_.

To unlock a thread:

1. Click _Unlock_.

When a thread is unlocked, forum members can resume all thread activities.

## Moving Threads

If someone posts a thread to the wrong category, site administrators can move it to the proper one. Follow these steps:

1. Select _Move_ from the thread’s Actions menu (![Actions](./creating-message-boards-categories/images/05.png)).
1. Click the _Select_ button and select the new category.
1. To add a post explaining the move, check _Add explanation post_.

1. Click _Move_ to move the thread.

The thread is now in the new category.

## Banning Users

Unfortunately, message board users can be abusive. In this case, moderators can ban the user from the message boards. To ban a user:

1. Click on the thread that contains the user to be banned.
1. Click the post’s Actions menu (![Actions](./creating-message-boards-categories/images/05.png)) and select Ban this User.

![Banning a user](./moderating-message-boards/images/04.png)

The user is now banned.

To reinstate a banned user:

1. Navigate to the _Site Administration_.
1. Click _Content & Data_ &rarr; _Message Boards_. (If there is a page scope, select the scope from the _scope selector_.)
1. Click the _Banned Users_ tab.
1. Click on Actions menu (Actions) next to the user and click _Unban This User_.

This user has been reinstated.

## Reviewing Flagged Threads

When a thread has been reported for possible abuse, the _Message Boards_ apps uses the _Notifications_ widget to notify the moderator to review the thread. A red number around their icon appears around their profile icon.

1. Click _Notifications

1. Click _Actions_ (![Actions](./moderating-message-boards/images/07.png))
1. Click _Delete_
1. Click _OK_ to confirm the deletion.

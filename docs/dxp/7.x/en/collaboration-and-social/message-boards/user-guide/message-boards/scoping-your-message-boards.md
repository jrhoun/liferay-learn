# Scoping Your Message Boards

Forum administrators can create and manage message boards in the Global, Site, and Page [scopes](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360028819992-Widget-Scope). The following sections show administrators how to use this menu to manage message boards in each of these scopes.

## Globally-scoped Message Boards

All content created on the global site becomes available on all other sites.

To manage a message board in the global scope, follow these steps:

1. Open the _Menu_ (![Menu](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/01.png)), then click the compass icon (![Compass](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/02.png)) on the Site Administration menu. This opens the Select Site dialog.
1. Select the _My Sites_ tab, then select _Global_.

1. Select _Message Boards_ from the _Content & Data_ menu. Any changes made here apply to the global scope.

    ![Figure 2: After changing to the global scope, select _Message Boards_ from the _Content & Data_ menu in Site Administration.](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/04.png)

## Site-scoped Message Boards

By default, the _Message Boards_ app in _Site Administration_ is scoped to the current Site. This means message boards from a site about the _Lunar Resort_ does not display on a site about raising tropical fish.

## Page-scoped Message Boards

Creating page-scoped message boards allows forum members to view different message boards on different pages housed on the same site. The example below have the same content on both site pages (_Forum 1_ and _Forum 2_.)

To create a page-scoped message board, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the page that which will be scoped (_Forum 2_).
1. Click the _Options_ icon (![Options](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/06.png)) in the widget's title bar and select _Configuration_.
1. Click the _Scope_ tab.
1. Select the page's name or _PageName (Create New)_ if the page scope doesn't exist yet.

1. Click _Save_ then close the dialog window.

A new page scope has been created. Because this is a new page scope, there is no content just yet. Any future message boards content that is created on this page will be displayed only here.

### Managing Page-scoped Content

Note that administrators must still use the _Site Administration_ menu to administer a page-scoped Message Boards widget by setting the _Site Administration_ menu's active scope. Follow these steps to do this:

1. Open the _Menu_ (![Menu](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/01.png)), expand the menu for your Site, then expand _Content & Data_.

1. The current scope appears just below the _Content & Data_ heading. _Default Scope_ is the current Site. To change this, click the gear icon (![Gear](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/09.png)) and then select your desired scope. This changes the Site Administration menu to reflect scope you selected. To work in a page's scope, for example, select that page from the gear icon. That page's name then becomes the _Site Administration_ menu's title.

    ![Figure 6: Select the page's scope under the _Content & Data_ menu in Site Administration.](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/10.png)

1. Select *Message Boards* from the _Content & Data_ menu. Any changes you make here apply to the scope that you selected in the previous step.

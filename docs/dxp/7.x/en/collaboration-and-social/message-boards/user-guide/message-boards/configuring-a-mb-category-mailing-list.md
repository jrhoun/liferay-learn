1. Expand the _Mailing List_ section.
1. Switch the _Active_ toggle to _YES_.
1. Leave the _Allow Anonymous Emails_ toggle as _NO_.

   * **Email address**: the dedicated email address for this category (for example: replies@lunar-resort.com)
   * **Protocol**: POP
   * **Server Name**: the mail serverâ€™s host name
   * **Server Port**: The port on which the mail service is running (110)

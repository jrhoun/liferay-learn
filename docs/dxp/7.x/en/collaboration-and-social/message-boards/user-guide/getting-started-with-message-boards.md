# Getting Started with Message Boards

Liferay DXP's Message Boards app is a forum application which can be added to any DXP site page. A Message Board on DXP can be [scoped to a site](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360028819992-Widget-Scope), including a regular site, an organizationâ€™s site, or a user's profile site or dashboard site.

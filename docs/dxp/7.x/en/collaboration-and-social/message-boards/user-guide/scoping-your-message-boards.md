# Scoping Your Message Boards

Forum administrators can create and choose to manage Message Boards in either the [Global, Site, or Page Scopes](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360028819992-Widget-Scope). The following sections show administrators how to setup and manage Message Boards in each of these scopes.

## Global

Content created at the global site scope level is available on all other sites. Content created to a globally scoped Message Board will therefore be visible to all other sites on a DXP instance.

### Managing a Globally Scoped Message Board

To manage a message board in the global scope, follow these steps:

1. Open the _Product Menu_ (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)), then click the compass icon (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) on the Site Administration menu. This opens the Select Site dialog.
1. Select the _My Sites_ tab, then select _Global_.

1. Select _Message Boards_ from the _Content & Data_ menu. Any changes made here apply to the global scope.

    ![Figure 2: After changing to the global scope, select Message Boards from the Content & Data menu in Site Administration.](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/02.png)

## Site

By default, the _Message Boards_ app in _Site Administration_ is scoped to the current Site. Message Boards scoped to a particular site are not visible when viewing Messages Boards that may be deployed on another site in the same instance.

## Page

Coming soon!
<!-- Creating page-scoped message boards allows forum members to view different message boards on different pages housed on the same site. The example below have the same content on both site pages (_Forum 1_ and _Forum 2_.)

### Creating a Page Scoped Message Board

To create a page-scoped message board, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the page that which will be scoped (_Forum 2_).
1. Click the _Options_ icon (![Options](../../../images/icon-widget-options.png)) in the widget's title bar and select _Configuration_.
1. Click the _Scope_ tab.
1. Select the page's name or _PageName (Create New)_ if the page scope doesn't exist yet.

   ![Figure 4. Page-scoped content](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/04.png)

1. Click _Save_ then close the dialog window.

    ![Figure 5: Page-scoped content](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/05.png)

The _Message Boards Categories_ and _Threads_ added on the _Forum 2_ page will be displayed only on that page.

### Managing Page Scoped Message Board

Note that administrators must still use the _Site Administration_ menu to administer a page-scoped Message Boards widget by setting the _Site Administration_ menu's active scope. Follow these steps to do this:

1. Open the _Product Menu_ (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png), expand the menu for your Site, then expand _Content & Data_.

1. The current scope appears just below the _Content & Data_ heading. _Default Scope_ is the current Site. To change this, click the gear icon (![Gear](../../../images/icon-control-menu-gear.png)) and then select your desired scope. This changes the Site Administration menu to reflect scope you selected. To work in a page's scope, for example, select that page from the gear icon. That page's name then becomes the _Site Administration_ menu's title.

    ![Figure 6: Select the page's scope under the Content & Data menu in Site Administration.](./scoping-your-message-boards/images/06.png)

1. Select *Message Boards* from the _Content & Data_ menu. Any changes you make here apply to the scope that you selected in the previous step. -->

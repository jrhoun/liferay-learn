# Managing Notifications and Requests

Users receive notifications and requests if they have subscribed to a blog or message board, or if someone sent them a private message, invitation, event reminder, or were mentioned in a post.

To access notifications and requests:

1. Click your avatar and select *Notifications*.

## Managing Notifications

Notifications can pile up after some time, especially if you were away for a few days. To filter and sort your notifications:

1. Click the _Filter and Order_ dropdown menu.
1. Choose from:

    * **All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications.
    * **Unread:** Displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the notification.
    * **Read:** Displays notifications that have been marked as read.
    * **Date:** Order notifications by date.

By default, notifications are listed by date in descending order. To sort notifications by ascending order, click the up/down arrow icon in the management bar.

To change your notification's status:

1. Click the *Actions* menu (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the notification.

    * **Mark as Unread** (![Closed Envelope](./managing-notifications-and-requests/images/icon-envelope-closed.png))

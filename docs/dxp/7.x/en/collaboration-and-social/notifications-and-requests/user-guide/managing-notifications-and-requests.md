# Managing Notifications and Requests

Users receive notifications and requests if they have subscribed to a blog or message board or are [mentioned](./mentioning-users.md) in a post. They may also be notified if someone sent them a private message, invitation to join a site, or an event reminder. Lastly, users are notified to review content and asset creation when those activities are used with Liferay's built-in [Workflow](../../../process-automation/workflow/introduction-to-workflow.md) capabilities.

To access notifications and requests:

1. Click your avatar and select *Notifications*.

    * **All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications.
    * **Unread:** Displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the notification.

    * **Mark as Unread** (![Closed Envelope](./managing-notifications-and-requests/images/icon-envelope-closed.png))
    * **Delete** (![Delete Button](./managing-notifications-and-requests/images/icon-delete.png))

# Using the Contacts Center Widget

The _Contacts Center_ widget lets users form these connection types:

-   Connection: A two-way relationship formed by a user accepting a connection request from another user. The Activities widget on each user’s private Dashboard displays the activities of the other user.
-   Following: A one-way relationship in which one user follows another user. The followed user’s activities appear in the Activities widget on the follower's private Dashboard.

After the widget is deployed on a user's private Dashboard, users can form their own social connections.

# Search Results

A User enters a search term, waits an infinitesimal amount of time, and the perfectly matching asset is delivered at the top of a list of other extremely relevant search hits. Like this:

The developers of a content type (an _asset_ in Liferay DXP) control much about how the asset's information is stored in the search engine (this process is called *indexing*), and how its information is searched and returned in the search results.  Developers who dislike how a particular asset behaves in search can use an *Indexer Post Processor* to modify the asset's indexing behavior and how search queries are constructed to look up the assets in @product@.

The Search Results behavior configurable through the UI is covered in this section:

- [Search Results Display Settings](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/display-settings)

- [Filtering Results](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/filtering-search-results-with-the-custom-filter-widget) 

- [Sorting Results](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/sorting-search-results-with-the-sort-widget)

# Handling Deprecations in Liferay DXP 7.2

<!-- reconsider the title to "Deprecations in Liferay DXP 7.2 -->

Liferay DXP will sometimes stop developing or remove features with new versions. In DXP 7.2, Liferay has deprecated several apps and features.

Liferay uses three different forms of feature deprecation:

1. Deprecated features that remain in DXP 7.2, but will be removed in a future release. (Availability: *Bundled*)

2. Deprecated features that have been removed from DXP 7.2, yet are still available for download via [Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) (Availability: *Marketplace*)

3. Deprecated features that have been removed from DXP 7.2 and aren't available for download. (Availability: *Removed*) <!-- isn't this basically feature removed and not even deprecated? -->

> **Note:** All applications deprecated by Liferay are no longer in active development. You should therefore plan to stop using these applications. Such applications, however, may still be available for download.

Features deprecated in earlier versions of Liferay DXP may also need to be considered, if you are upgrading from an earlier version than 7.1. See the following deprecations for any versions between your version pre-upgrade and 7.2:

* Liferay DXP 7.1: [link]()
* Liferay DXP 7.0: [link]()

The deprecations in DXP 7.2 are as follows:

## Applications in Maintenance Mode

Although no action is immediately necessary, you may also want to consider applications that are put into maintenance mode in DXP 7.2. These applications are not being deprecated or removed, but will no longer receive updates other than bug fixes. See [Features in Maintenance Mode](./99-features-in-maintenance-mode.md) for more information.

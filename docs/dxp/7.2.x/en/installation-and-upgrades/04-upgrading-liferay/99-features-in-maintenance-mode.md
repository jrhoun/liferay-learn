# Features in Maintenance Mode

Liferay may cease enhancing certain products or capabilities on a case by case basis. The affected products or capabilities are put into _maintenance mode_. Liferay actively supports and provides bug fixes for products or capabilities in maintenance mode, in accordance with the end of service life policies of the compatible Liferay DXP version and a subscribers' subscription level (if applicable).

> **Note:** Maintenance mode does not necessarily mean that deprecation is planned for the product or capability.

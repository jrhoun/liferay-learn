# Patching Liferay DXP 

While we strive for perfection with every DXP release, the reality of the human condition dictates that releases may not be as perfect as originally intended. But we've planned for that by providing patches for DXP subscribers and a Patching Tool for installing them. 

## Overview

- [Patch Types](./04-patch-types.md): All patches fix bugs, and some patches focus on security. While Liferay makes patches to all subscribers regularly, the Liferay support team works with customers to provide quick fixes for particular urgent situations. It's important to familiarize yourself with all of the patch types. 

- [The Patching Process](./05-the-patching-process.md): Provides a workflow for patching a DXP installation.  

- [Patching a DXP WAR](./06-patching-a-dxp-war.md): Demonstrates patching a DXP WAR file, dependencies, and OSGi JARs for deploying to a supported application server. 

- [Installing the Patching Tool](./07-installing-the-patching-tool.md): Install the Patching Tool and update it following these instructions. 

- [Configuring the Patching Tool](./08-configuring-the-patching-tool.md): Explains how to configure the Patching Tool with DXP runtime environments.

- [Working with Patches](./09-working-with-patches.md): Demonstrates how to manage patches, starting with getting information on your DXP version, patches installed, and patches available locally. It goes on to cover uninstalling patches, patch cleanup, and handling collisions between patches and deployed plugins. 

- [Keeping Up With Fix Packs and Service Packs](./11-keeping-up-with-fix-packs.md): Stay updated with the latest patches, products, and information for maintaining DXP installations.

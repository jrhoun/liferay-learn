# Activating Liferay DXP

There are two ways to activate a Liferay DXP instance:

* Request an XML activation key from [Liferay Support](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us).

* Online activation through Liferay Connected Services (LCS). Liferay DXP 7.0 introduced LCS as a way to activate Liferay DXP instances. LCS can also install fix packs, monitor each instance's performance, and help administrators automatically manage Liferay DXP subscriptions. See the [LCS documentation](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360029032071-Introduction-to-Managing-Liferay-DXP-with-Liferay-Connected-Services) for instructions on activating the instances with LCS.

| **Note:** Administrators must use LCS for activation of Elastic subscriptions. Otherwise, LCS for activation is optional. Instead request an XML activation key from Liferay Support.

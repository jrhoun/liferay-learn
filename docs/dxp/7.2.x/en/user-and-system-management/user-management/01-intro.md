# Users and Organizations

*Users* and *Organizations* are fundamental entities. If your site requires people (even just a set of site administrators) to have accounts to do anything, you need to know about Users. If your Users are at all divided hierarchically, like into departments, you'll find that Organizations are helpful. 

Users and Organizations are managed in the Control Panel's *Users and Organizations* section.

These are just a few examples of activities executed from the Users and Organizations section of the Control Panel: 

- An employee leaves the company, requiring account deletion

- An employee joins the company and must be added to the portal, and to a specific department.

- An employee is promoted to a new role and needs additional permissions within the portal.

- Organize the Users by department with Organizations.

- Add new departments (as Organizations, most likely) and give the department's employees their own internal website.

- An employee gets married, and their name changes.

## What are Users?

In case there's any confusion over the term, a User is an entity that can sign into the portal and do something. Generally a User has more privileges, called Permissions, than a Guest of your site, who does not sign in. Users are assigned Roles, and Roles define the User's privileges.

Now that you understand Users in the portal environment, read about Organizations [here](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/organizations).

The remaining articles in this section give you guidance on managing (creating, deleting, editing, and more) Users and Organizations.

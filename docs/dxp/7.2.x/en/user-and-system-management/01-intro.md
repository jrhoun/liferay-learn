# Managing Users

Ever heard a retailer advertise as a "one stop shop" for anything you want? The idea is they have so much stuff that whatever you want is probably there. Liferay's Control Panel is a "one stop shop" where you create Users, Organizations, and Sites, where you configure permissions, plugins, and pretty much anything else.

The Control Panel is divided into six main areas: 

- Users 
- Sites
- Apps
- Configuration
- Workflow
- [DXP Only] Search Tuning

The Users section lets you create and manage Users, Organizations, User Groups, Roles, and Password Policies. If monitoring has been enabled, you can also view all the live sessions of your Users.

> **Anonymous User:** *Anonymous Anonymous* is used for the [Managing User Data](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-user-data) functionality. Created the first time an administrator clicks *Delete Personal Data* for a User, *Anonymous Anonymous* is a deactivated User assigned [anonymized assets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-user-data#anonymizing-data). The Anonymous User is configurable, so the name and configuration details might be different in your virtual instance.

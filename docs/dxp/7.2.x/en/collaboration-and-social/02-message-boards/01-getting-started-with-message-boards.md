# Getting Started with Message Boards

Liferay DXP's Message Boards app is a state of the art forum application which can be added to any DXP site page. A message board on DXP can be [scoped to a site](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360028819992-Widget-Scope), including a regular site, an organizationâ€™s site, or a user's profile site or dashboard site.

## Deploying the Message Boards App

The fastest way to begin using the _Message Boards_ app is to deploy the MB widget to a site page. See the [Creating Page](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360029132211-Creating-Pages) article on how to create page.

1. Navigate to the site where the forum is to be created (in this example, the default Liferay DXP Guest site).
1. Go to the site page (e.g. _Forum Page_)

    ![New Forum Page](./getting-started-with-message-boards/images/03.png)

1. Click the _Add_ button.
1. Click _Widgets_ then _Collaboration_ to expand the menu.
1. Drag and drop the _Message Boards_ widget to the desired location on the page.

Site members are able to create forum posts using the _Message Boards_ widget. Note that there can be only one _Message Boards_ widget per page; you can have multiple Message Boards widgets deployed across multiple site pages.

## Message Boards Features

### Categories

Site administrators can use _Message Boards Categories_ to organize multiple threads about a similar topic (for example, discussions about Star Wars or MCU). _Categories_ can also be moved and merged. To learn how to create and manage _Categories_, see the [Creating and Managing Message Boards Categories](./02-creating-message-boards-categories.md) article.

### Creating Threads

There are multiple features in _Threads_ to create lively discussions:

* Write posts in BBCode or with the standard WYSIWYG editor
* Mark a thread as a question and select an answer from the replies.
* Assign thread priority (e.g., sticky, announcement, etc.)
* Attach files to a thread
* Reply to threads

To start posting a thread, see the [Threads](./03-creating-message-boards-threads.md) article.

### Managing Threads

The _Message Boards_ app contains features to facilitate day to day administration. For example, threads can be flagged for possible abuse, or locked to prevent further activity. Threads can also be split into two separate threads. To learn more, see the [Managing Threads](./04-managing-message-boards.md) article.

### Subscriptions and Notifications

The _Message Boards_ app has several functions for users to stay updated on the threads they are following or contributing to. Users can also respond to threads via email. Here, you can learn how to:

* Configuring Email Lists
* Publishing through RSS

### Content Scope

As mentioned above, message boards can be scoped to a page, a site, or the entire portal. See [Scoping your Message Boards](./06-scoping-your-message-boards.md)

### Managing Users

Site administrators have the ability to track user activity:

* Banning and reinstating users
* Rank users by the number of messages they post and assign labels to these rankings (e.g., novice, legend, etc.)

See the [Managing Users]() article for more information.

# Message Boards Widget Reference

## Categories

In the Categories tab, you can view a category's thread listing by clicking the category's name.

## Recent Posts tabs

The Recent Posts tab also lists threads, except they're the latest threads across all categories.

## My Posts

## My Subscriptions

Subscribing to a thread causes Message Boards to send the user an email whenever a new message is posted to the thread. If you have enabled the mailing list feature for the thread's category, users can reply to these messages to post back to the thread without having to visit your site.

Within a category, you can subscribe to an RSS feed and/or emails that inform you about activity in that category.

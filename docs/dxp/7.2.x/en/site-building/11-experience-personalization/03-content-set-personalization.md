# Content Set Personalization

You can modify Content Sets to create a personalized variation for members of a specific User Segment. Follow these steps:

1.  Open the Product Menu and select *Content & Data* &rarr; *Content Sets* under your Site's menu.

2.  Select an existing Content Set or [create a new Content Set](TODO).

3.  Click the *Actions* button ![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png) &rarr; *Edit* for the Content Set you wish to personalize.

4.  Click the *New Personalized Variation* button next to the Content Set if there are *No Personalized Variations yet*, otherwise click the `+` button next to Personalized Variations.

5.  Select a User Segment from the next page to create a variation for that User Segment.

6.  Select the content that you want to display for the Content Set in the selected User Segment.

Now anytime a member of the User Segment views this Content Set in context, such as in an Asset Publisher, they see the personalized version and not the default. Each new variation copies the default Content Set, but then essentially functions as its own Content Set after that. 

## Managing Content Set Personalization

To edit or manage a Content Set Variation,

1.  Click on the User Segment name under *Personalized Variations* or click *Anyone* to modify the default variation.

2.  Click on the *Actions* button (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the User Segment and select *View Content* to preview the content in that set or *Delete* to remove it.

# Personalizing Experiences

Once you've [created some User Segments](../10-segmentation/01-segmentation-intro.md), you can use the data to provide users and site visitors with the best possible experience, and drive campaigns and content engagement, by displaying content that appeals to their interests and targets their demographic. For example, you can display information on a basic free checking account to a visitor who entered the site through a landing page from a promotion at a local college, while instead recommending options for optimizing retirement account contributions for established customers. Content Page Personalization and Content List Personalization are two key aspects of creating personalized user experiences.

## Content Page Personalization

Content Page Personalization dynamically changes the page layout and content based on who is viewing the page. You can create *Experiences* for any [Content Page](../02-creating-pages/05-building-content-pages.md) which provide different text, images, widgets, and even different layouts based on the User Segment criteria of the user viewing the page. See [Content Page Personalization](./02-content-page-personalization.md) for more information.

## Content Set Personalization

[Content Sets](TODO) organize and display content. Content Set Personalization provides dynamic selection of Content Sets based on User Segments. This means the Content Set which displays in a given context is determined by their User Segment criteria. For example, you could use a content list to display "featured" articles at the top of a page. Then you could create User Segments containing users who should receive more specialized content, rather than the default. Those Segments would then see content personalized to their interest rather than the default. See [Content Set Personalization](./03-content-set-personalization.md) for more information.

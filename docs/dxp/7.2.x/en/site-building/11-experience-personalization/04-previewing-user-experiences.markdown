# Previewing User Experiences

As an Administrator, when you view a page, you can preview the different experiences that users can have on that page.

1. Navigate to the page you want to preview the user experiences on and click the *Simulation* button (![Simulation](./images/icon-simulation.png)) at the top of the page.
 
2.  Select a User Segment from the *Segments* selection to preview the page as a member of that User Segment.
 
Viewing the perspective of a User Segment previews any personalizations for Content Pages or Content Sets for that User Segment.

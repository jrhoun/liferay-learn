# Publishing Assets

As you create web content, remember that pieces of content are assets, just like message board entries and blog posts. The most common type of asset is [Web Content](TODO:creating-web-content). Other types of assets include blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts, bookmarks, and documents. Developers can define custom asset types that use the asset framework, which provides support for tags, categories, vocabularies, comments, ratings, and asset relationships.

The Asset Publisher widget displays assets. It has many configuration options. By default, the Asset Publisher displays abstracts (previews) of recently published assets with links to their full views. You can configure the Asset Publisher to display a table of assets, a list of asset titles, or the full content of assets. You can also configure it to display specific assets, and choose how many items to display in a list. You might use Asset Publisher to display chosen content types, recent content, or content by tags and categories. 

Since the Asset Publisher publishes assets, it excels at publishing mixed content types like images, documents, blogs, and of course, web content. This helps create a more dynamic website. you can place user-created wiki entries, blog posts, or message board messages in context with your web content.

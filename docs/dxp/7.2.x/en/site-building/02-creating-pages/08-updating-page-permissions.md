# Updating Page Permissions

Public Pages can be viewed by anyone, and private pages are only private from non-members of the Site. If someone has joined your site or is a member of your Organization, that person can see all the private pages. You can override this default behavior by modifying the permissions of an individual page so only certain users can view them. Follow these steps to update the permissions for a page:

1.  Open the Product Menu and select *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* under your site's menu.

2.  Select the Page Set (*Public Pages* or *Private Pages*) that contains the page you want to update permissions for.

3.  Open the *Options* (![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) Menu next to the page and select *Permissions*.

4.  Check/uncheck the permissions for the Role(s). For example, you could uncheck the *View* and *Add Discussion* permissions next to the Site Member Role for a private page to create a page that only site administrators can view.

5.  Click *Save* to apply the changes.

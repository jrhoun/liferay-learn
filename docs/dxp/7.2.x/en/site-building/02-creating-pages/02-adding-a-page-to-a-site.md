# Adding a Page to a Site

The steps below describe how to add a new page to your Site and configure the general options. To learn how to configure the remaining page settings, see [Configuring Individual Pages](./06-configuring-individual-pages.md), or see [Configuring Page Sets](./05-configuring-page-sets.md) to configure options for the Page Set. 

A page can belong to one of two Page Sets:

- **Public Pages:**

  - Can be accessed by anyone, including Users who haven't logged in
  
  - Has URLs different from Private Pages and can have unique content, applications, themes, and layouts

- **Private Pages:**

  - Can only be accessed by Site members
  
  - Has URLs different from Public Pages and can have unique content, applications, themes, and layouts



Follow these steps to add a page:

1.  If you're not currently on the Site you want to edit, Open the Product Menu and click the *Site Selector* button (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) next to your current Site name and select your desired Site.

2.  Go to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* under the Site Menu.

3.  On the Pages page, click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) next to the Public or Private Page Set to create a top-level page, or click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) next to an existing page to create a child page below the page you've selected. You can nest pages as deep as you like. You can also click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) in the top right to create a top-level page.

4.  Choose a [page type](./01-understanding-pages.md#page-types) under *Basic Pages* or select *Global Template* or another Page Template collection underneath the Collections heading to create a page from a [Page Template](./07-creating-a-page-template).

5.  Enter a Name and configure the remaining settings for the page. Follow the instructions in [Configuring Content Pages](./04-building-content-pages.md) if you're adding a Content Page.

6.  Click *Save* to create the page.

Creating a page by default also adds it to any Navigation Menus that are configured to have new pages added to them. If you don't want a new page added to a specific Navigation Menu that is listed during page creation, uncheck the box for that menu. Pages are as flexible as pages you'd create manually without Liferay Portal. Using an intuitive interface, you can define your Site any way you want. You can create and remove pages, export and import them, set their layouts, define how they are indexed by search engines, and more.

After you've added a page, it may be difficult to track what kind of page you're currently viewing. The page type appears at the top of the page to help you determine the administration options you have and where you need to go to configure the page.

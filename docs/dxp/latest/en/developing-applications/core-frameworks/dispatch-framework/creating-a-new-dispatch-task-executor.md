# Creating a New Dispatch Task Executor

Liferay Dispatch is a flexible framework built on top of Liferay's Scheduler Engine that you can use to add, execute, and schedule tasks across a Liferay instance. Each Dispatch Task is created using an implementation of the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface and can be customized to execute any logic. While Liferay DXP provides multiple out-of-the-box executors, you can create your own. Once created and deployed, you can use it to add Dispatch Tasks to a Liferay instance.

Follow these steps to create your own implementation of the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface:

1. **OSGI Component**: Declare the module a Component within the OSGi framework using the `@Component` annotation.

1. **Service**: Identify the module as a `DispatchTaskExecutor.class` service within the `@Component` annotation.

1. **OSGi Properties**: Add the following properties to the `@Component` annotation.

   * `dispatch.task.executor.name`: this property defines the string used for the executor's name in the Dispatch UI. language key value that is used to resolve Dispatch Task Executor type localized name in the Dispatch UI.

      ```note::
         If you want your Dispatch Task to use localized names, add a language key value for the ``dispatch.task.executor.name`` property to the moduleâ€™s ``resources/content/Language.properties`` file.
      ```

   * `dispatch.task.executor.type`: this property defines a unique `type` value used to match the right Dispatch Task Executor and Dispatch Trigger.

      ```note::
         Each value must be unique to ensure the correct executor is used. If a value is not unique, an error is displayed in the log on startup indicating which executors have the same property value.
      ```

1. [**`DispatchTaskExecutor`**](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/dispatch/dispatch-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/dispatch/executor/DispatchTaskExecutor.java): Implement the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface, or extend an implementation of it (e.g., ``BaseDispatchTaskExecutor``).

      ```important::
         Any implementation of the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface must handle status logs for Dispatch tasks. This is because the Dispatch framework depends on those logs to control the concurrent execution of tasks.
         
         For your convenience, Liferay provides the ``BaseDispatchTaskExecutor`` abstract `class <https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/dispatch/dispatch-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/dispatch/executor/BaseDispatchTaskExecutor.java>`_ that logs the Dispatch task's status as ``IN PROGRESS``, ``SUCCESSFUL``, or ``FAILED``.
      ```

1. **Methods**: If you're implementing the `DispatchTaskExecutor` interface directly, override its `execute()` method to implement custom logic. However, if you're extending the ``BaseDispatchTaskExecutor`` abstract class, override its `doExecute()` method.

   ```note::
      The ``getName()`` method is deprecated and replaced by the ``dispatch.task.executor.name`` property.
   ```

   ```tip::
      You can use the ``dispatchTrigger.getDispatchTaskSettings()`` method to fetch properties set in the Dispatch Task's Settings editor.
   ```

The following tutorial uses a sample module to demonstrate how to create and deploy a custom Dispatch Task Executor to a Liferay instance.

## Deploying the Sample Dispatch Task Executor

Follow these steps to download, build, and deploy the sample Dispatch Task Executor to a new docker container:

1. Start a new [Liferay Docker container](../../installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/using-liferay-docker-images/docker-container-basics.md).

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 [$LIFERAY_LEARN_DXP_DOCKER_IMAGE$]
   ```

1. Download and unzip the example module.

   ```bash
   curl https://learn.liferay.com/docs/dxp/latest/en/developing-applications/core-frameworks/dispatch-framework/liferay-s7a3.zip -O
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip liferay-s7a3.zip -d liferay-s7a3
   ```

1. Run the following `gradlew` command to build the JAR file and deploy it to your new Docker container:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
   ```

   The JAR is generated in the `build/libs` folder (i.e., `s7a3-web/build/libs/com.acme.s7a3.dispatch.executor.web-1.0.0.jar`).

1. Confirm the module was successfully deployed and started via the container console.

   ```log
   Processing com.acme.s7a3.dispatch.executor.web-1.0.0.jar
   STARTED com.acme.s7a3.dispatch.executor.web_1.0.0 [1656]
   ```

1. Verify the module is working by using it to [add a new Dispatch Task](./using-dispatch.md#adding-a-new-dspatch-task) to your Liferay instance.

   ![Add a new Dispatch Task using the new template.](./creating-a-new-dispatch-task-executor/images/01.png)

   Once you've created the task, click on *Run Now*.

   ![Click Run Now for your new Dispatch Task.](./creating-a-new-dispatch-task-executor/images/02.png)

   If successful, it should print "Hello World!" to the console when executed.

   ```log
      Hello World!
   ```

   You can also click on the Dispatch Task and go to the *Logs* tab to see a list of all previous runs.

## Code for the Sample Dispatch Task Executor

```java
@Component(
    immediate = true,
    property = {
        "dispatch.task.executor.name=s7a3-hello-world",
        "dispatch.task.executor.type=helloWorld"
    },
    service = DispatchTaskExecutor.class
)
public class S7A3DispatchTaskExecutor extends BaseDispatchTaskExecutor {

    @Override
    public void doExecute(
            DispatchTrigger dispatchTrigger,
            DispatchTaskExecutorOutput dispatchTaskExecutorOutput)
        throws IOException, PortalException {

        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return null;
    }

}
```

The module is declared an OSGi `@Component` and defines two properties: `dispatch.task.executor.name` and `dispatch.task.executor.type`. It then identifies the module as a `DispatchTaskExecutor.class` service.

Following the `@Component` annotation, the module extends the `BaseDispatchTaskExecutor` abstract class and overrides the `doExecute` method to print "Hello World!"

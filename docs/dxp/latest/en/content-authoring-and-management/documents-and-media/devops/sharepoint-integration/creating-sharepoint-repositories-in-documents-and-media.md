# Creating SharePoint Repositories in Documents and Media

Once you've added a [SharePoint OAuth2 configuration], you can use it to create repositories in Documents and Media that are mounted to SharePoint libraries.

Follow these steps:

1. Open the Documents and Media application in a Site or Asset Library.

1. Click *Add* (![Add Button](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and select *Repository*.

1. Enter a name and description for the repository.

1. Fill out the fields on the form (see below).

1. Define permissions for the new Documents and Media SharePoint repository.

1. Click *Save* when finished.

**Repository Type**: Select the desired SharePoint Repository Configuration.

**Site Absolute URL**: Enter an absolute URL to resolve relative URLs (e.g., `https://[your-site-name].sharepoint.com` for SharePoint Online).

**Library Path**: Enter a relative path from the Site Absolute URL that points to the SharePoint Document Library you want to mount in Documents and Media.

Users with the proper permissions can read/write SharePoint documents and folders, perform document check-in/check-out, download documents, and more. Each action performed in one context is propagated in the other.

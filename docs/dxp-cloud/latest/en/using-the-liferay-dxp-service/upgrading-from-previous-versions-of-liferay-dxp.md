# Upgrading from Previous Versions of Liferay DXP

Upgrading the Liferay DXP service from 7.0 to a newer version on DXP Cloud requires careful planning, testing and execution in order to be successful. There are, however, several features that streamline this process.

Regardless of whether the upgrade is performed on DXP Cloud on or on site, developers should still make multiple backups at each phase of the project.

Important Note: The process below is subject to further changes in the future.

## Roadmap

1. [Obtain the Upgrade Environment](#obtain-the-upgrade-environment)
1. [Obtain the required files.](#obtain-the-required-files)
1. [Prepare the Upgrade Environment.](#prepare-the-upgrade-environment)
1. [Running the Upgrade](#running-the-upgrade)

## Obtain the Upgrade Environment

Before upgrading the production instance, perform an upgrade simulation in your dev or QA environment. Before beginning the upgrade process, take a backup of your production instance. Since by default only the DXP Cloud `prd` environment has the Backup and Restore functions, to use Backup and Restore on a different environment you must request that environment be marked as a `prd` type so you can backup that environment in case an upgrade simulation fails.

Open a [Help Center](https://liferay-support.zendesk.com/agent/) ticket to request the environment.

## Obtain the required files

The following files are required:

* `app-server.properties`
* `portal-upgrade-database.properties`
* `portal-upgrade-ext.properties`
* `db_upgrade.sh`
* `com.liferay.portal.tools.db.upgrade.client.jar`

You can [download these files](https://customer.liferay.com/download) in a Liferay DXP DB Upgrade Client.

1. Select the Product version for the upgrade environment (DXP 7.1 or 7.2).
1. Select _Product/Service Packs_ from the File Type drop down menu.
1. Click _Download_ for the corresponding Liferay DXP DB Upgrade Client.
1. Unzip the zip file.

## Prepare the Upgrade Environment

1. Navigate to the project's `/lcp/liferay/script` folder.
1. By default, the folders `common`, `dev`, `uat`, and `prd` are present. You can create a new folder or use an existing one to perform an upgrade. If it's a new folder, it should match the environment being upgraded.
1. Place the files listed above in the folder where the upgrade is performed (e.g. `prd`).

### Update the `app-server.properties`

```properties
dir=/opt/liferay/tomcat
extra.lib.dirs=/bin
global.lib.dir=/lib
portal.dir=/webapps/ROOT
server.detector.server.id=tomcat
```

### Update the `portal-upgrade-database.properties`

Enter these properties:

```properties
jdbc.default.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.default.url=jdbc:mysql://database/lportal?dontTrackOpenResources=true&holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose=true&useFastDateParsing=false
jdbc.default.username=dxpcloud
jdbc.default.password=PASSWORD_HERE
```

Note: The database password is in the `portal-all.properties` file in `/lcp/liferay/config/common/`.

### Update the `portal-upgrade-ext.properties`

Enter this property: `liferay.home=/opt/liferay`

### Update Permissions (If Necessary)

It might be necessary to update permissions for the `db_upgrade.sh` and `com.liferay.portal.tools.db.upgrade.client.jar` files. Be aware of the risks when granting permissions.

### Submit the Changes

Once the configuration files have been modified and the `jar` and shell script is placed in the `/lcp/liferay/script` folder,

1. Commit the changes to the branch.
1. Open a pull request.

## Running the Upgrade

Once the pull request has been submitted, the DXP DB Upgrade Tool executes the upgrade process:

1. A new build is created.
1. The new build is tested on the Jenkins services.
1. Deploy the build on the upgrade environment; this could be a test environment or the production environment.
1. The upgrade process begins.

If the upgrade fails, restore the environment to a previous, stable build. Resolve whatever issues are in the database that caused the failure.

To locate and resolve any database issues during the upgrade process, the platform uses the `verify` process that runs on startup to detect integrity problems within the database. This check is done _once_ automatically by default. Change the frequency of the integrity check if necessary:

```properties
# Specify the frequency for verifying the integrity of the database.
    #
    # Constants in VerifyProcess:
    #     public static final int ALWAYS = -1;
    #     public static final int NEVER = 0;
    #     public static final int ONCE = 1;
    #
    # Env: LIFERAY_VERIFY_PERIOD_FREQUENCY
    #
    verify.frequency=1
```

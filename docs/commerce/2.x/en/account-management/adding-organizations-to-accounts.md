# Adding Organizations to Accounts

There are two ways to add organizations to an account: 1) using the _Account Management_ widget and 2) through the _Control Panel_. Access to the _Control Panel_ is typically restricted to those with administrative permissions for the store or installation.

## Using the Account Management Widget

1. Click the left _Navigation Menu_ → _Account Management_.
1. Click on an account (for example _South Bay Auto Parts Distributors_).
1. Click the _Add Organizations_ button.

## Using the Control Panel

Users who have administrative permissions for the store or installation may create and update account information in the _Control Panel_.

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Users_ → _Accounts_.
1. Click the (+) button to add a new account.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: _your company name_ (Acme International)
    * **Email**: _your company email_ (Acme1@acme.org)
    * **Type**: _Business_
    * **VAT Number**: _your VAT number*_

The new account has been created using the Control Panel. Click _Addresses_ to update the account's addresses. For more information, see the [Adding Addresses to an Account](../adding-addresses-to-an-account/README.md#using-the-control-panel) article.

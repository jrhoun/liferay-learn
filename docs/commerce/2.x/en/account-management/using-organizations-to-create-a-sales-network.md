# Using Organizations to Create a Sales Network

A business' sales network hierarchy can be mirrored in Liferay Commerce by using the Organizations feature. In Commerce and DXP, an Organization is a hierarchical arrangement of Users that can model real-world organizational hierarchies – such as a sales network – and that enables distributed and simplified management of Users, Roles, Permissions and Accounts, for enhanced security and collaboration.

> **Note:** A Role is a collection of permissions that can be granted to a User. A Permission is any specific assignable action a User may take, such as view a menu, account or widget, assign Roles, add Users, etc. For more on [Roles](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018174371-Managing-Roles) and [Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018174391-Defining-Role-Permissions), see these articles.

Organizations have different Organization Roles and users can be assigned to a specific role. Each Role can have different permissions to access different parts of the sales network or hierarchy.

Additionally, when someone transfers to another part of the organization, simply move the user to another Organization in Liferay Commerce.

Next, we'll illustrate each of these aspects of using Organizations to create a sales network.

## Mirror Real-World Organizational Hierarchies

Organizing a sales network and accounts exactly as in the real world makes it easy for sales team members to navigate within Liferay Commerce.

## Define Account Access With Organizational Roles and Permissions

Users can create custom roles with specific sets of permissions. Once the roles are created, assign them to each team member.

Some examples of Permissions include: view sub-Organizations (for example, Regions), account data or order history; manage orders, and assign Roles. For more on Permissions, see [Defining Role Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018174391-Defining-Role-Permissions).

## Manage Long-Term Access With Organizational Membership

Managing Roles and Permissions long-term can be easily accomplished within Liferay Commerce by managing a user's organizational membership (once Organizations, Roles and Permissions are set up and assigned).

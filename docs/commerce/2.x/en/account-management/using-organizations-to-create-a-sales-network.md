# Using Organizations to Create a Sales Network

A B2B business' real world sales network hierarchy can be mirrored in Liferay Commerce running on DXP using the Organizations feature. In Commerce and DXP, an Organization is a hierarchical arrangement of Users that can model real-world organizational hierarchies – such as a sales network – and that enables distributed and simplified management of Users, Roles, Permissions and Accounts, for enhanced security and collaboration.

> **Note:** A Role is a collection of permissions that can be granted to a User. A Permission is any specific assignable action a User may take, such as view a menu, account or widget, assign Roles, add Users, etc. For more on [Roles](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018174371-Managing-Roles) and [Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018174391-Defining-Role-Permissions), see these articles.

When Organizations are used along with assigning permissions to Organization Roles, Users simply need to be assigned to an Organization to inherit the correct Permissions that were defined for it. For example, a B2B company can give everyone in their sales network access to the right Account information through their organizational membership.

Additionally, when someone transfers to another part of the organization, simply move the user to another Organization in Liferay Commerce and there's no need to hassle with updating the user's individual Roles and Permissions. For example, a B2B company can quickly and easily add or remove access to Account information when there are sales network personnel changes, by simply changing the user's organizational membership.

Next, we'll illustrate each of these aspects of using Organizations to create a sales network.

## Mirror Real-World Organizational Hierarchies

Organizing a sales network and accounts exactly as in the real world makes it easy for sales team members to navigate within Liferay Commerce.

## Define Account Access With Organizational Roles and Permissions

Assigning Roles to every salesperson specifies what they can and can't do within Liferay Commerce (that is, once permissions are defined and assigned to roles).

Assigning a collection of Permissions to each Role defines that Role within Liferay Commerce (which can then be applied to users). Some examples of Permissions include: view sub-Organizations (for example, Regions), account data or order history; manage orders, and assign Roles. For more on Permissions, see [Defining Role Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018174391-Defining-Role-Permissions).

## Manage Long-Term Access With Organizational Membership

Managing Roles and Permissions long-term can be easily accomplished within Liferay Commerce by managing a user's organizational membership (once Organizations, Roles and Permissions are set up and assigned).

## Organized, Assigned, Defined and Managed

By organizing a sales network and accounts (or any organizational hierarchy) to mirror the real world hierarchy, assigning Roles to every salesperson (or team member) as well as defining Roles via Permissions, then managing Roles and Permissions long-term via organizational membership, a B2B business can use Organizations to create a sales network.

For step-by-step guidance how to set up Organizations, Roles and Permissions, as well as how to connect Accounts and Organizations for a sales network, see the [Additional Information](#additional-information) section, below.

Organizations, Roles & Permissions are a versatile feature of Liferay Commerce and DXP, capable of being used for numerous solutions.

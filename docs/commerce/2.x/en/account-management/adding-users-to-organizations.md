# Adding Users to Organizations

When a User (for example, a Sales Agent) belongs to a specific Organization in Liferay Commerce, he or she can then view (or depending on the role, possibly manage) the accounts associated with that Organization.

To add a User to an Organization:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Users_ → _Users and Organizations_.
1. Click on a user (for example _Federico Rossi_).
1. Click _Organizations_ on the left.
1. Click _Select_.
1. Click _Choose_ to select the Organization (for example, _Italy - South_)
1. Click Save.

The user has been added to the organization using the Control Panel via the User. To remove a User from an Organization, repeat the first three steps above and then:

1. Click the "x" to the far right of an Organization.
1. Click Save.

# Adding Tiered Pricing

Tiered pricing allows store owners to vary the price of a product based on the quantity ordered. A store could offer reduced prices for higher quantities ordered. Prices that are set via Tiered Pricing will take precedence over prices set directly against a given SKU for the associated users if a buyer meets the minimum quantity specified. This article describes how to add tiered pricing to an existing price list.

To create a pricing tier for a product in a price list:

1. Go to the _Global Applications_ menu &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Price Lists_.
1. Click on a price list (_VIP Customers_ in this example).
1. Click the _Entries_ tab.
1. Click on a product (_Premium Brake Fluid_ in this example).
1. In the _Price Tiers_ section, click the _Tiered Pricing_ radio button.
1. Click the (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) button.
1. Enter the following:

    - **Quantity**: 20 (This is the minimum quantity needed to receive the price for bulk quantity.)
    - **Tier Price**: 90.00
    - **Override Discount**: Yes
    - **Discount Levels**: 1
    - **Publish Date**: Enter a date and time.

A pricing tier (\$90) has been created for orders that reach the minimum quantity (20) for the product (_Premium Brake Fluid_) on the price list (_VIP Customers_).

# Creating a Price List

Price Lists are an easy way to set alternate prices (higher or lower than the base price) for a given product or allow use of a currency other than the store’s default for selected Accounts and Account Groups.

To create a new price list:

1. Go to the _Global Applications_ menu &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Price Lists_.
1. Click the (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) button.
1. Enter the following:

    - **Name**: VIP Customers
    - **Catalog**: Sahara.com
    - **Currency**: USD

1. Click _Submit_ when finished.

The new price list has been created. Once the price list has been created, determine the price list's eligibility, populate the items, and set the Price Modifiers.

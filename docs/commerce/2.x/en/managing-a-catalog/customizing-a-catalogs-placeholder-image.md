# Customizing A Catalog's Placeholder Image

Normally an item in the catalog can have at least one associated [product image](./creating-and-managing-products/products/product-images.md). If an product does not have a product image, Liferay Commerce uses the following image:

![Liferay Commerce uses a default placeholder image.](./customizing-a-catalogs-placeholder-image/images/01.png)

If there are multiple catalogs on the same Liferay Commerce instance, you can use a different placeholder image for each catalog.

To customize a catalog's placeholder image:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Catalogs_.

    ![The Catalog menu is in the Control Panel.](./customizing-a-catalogs-placeholder-image/images/02.png)

1. Click on the catalog (for example, _Sahara.com_).
1. Click the Refresh icon.

    ![Click the Refresh button to change the image.](./customizing-a-catalogs-placeholder-image/images/03.png)

1. Drag and drop a new file or click _Select File_ to add a new image.

     ![Verify the image.](./customizing-a-catalogs-placeholder-image/images/04.png)

1. Click _Save_ when finished.

The new image has been applied to all products without their own product images.

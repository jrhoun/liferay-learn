# Overriding Product Level Information

Product SKUs in a catalog typically inherit the specifications and configurations from the parent product. You can override certain product configurations or specifications on a per SKU basis. For example, individual SKUs can be configured to have shipping weights and dimensions that are distinct from the those configured for the product. Altering a specific SKU's weights and dimensions will update shipping calculations for that particular SKU.

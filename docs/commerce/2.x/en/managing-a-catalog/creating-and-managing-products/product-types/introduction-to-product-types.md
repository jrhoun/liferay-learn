# Introduction to Product Types

The catalog supports three product types: Simple, Grouped, and Virtual.

**[Simple Product](./creating-a-simple-product.md)**: Any physical product for which inventory is tracked.

**[Grouped Product](./creating-a-grouped-product.md)**: Two or more products from the catalog, packaged together to be sold as a single item. Grouped products are tracked in inventory. A grouped product can contain Simple Products, other Grouped Products, or Virtual Products.

**[Virtual Products](./creating-a-virtual-product.md)**: A Virtual Product is a non-tangible product that can be downloaded or have a specified duration. Examples include music files, electronic publications, services, and warranties. Otherwise, use a Simple product type.

# Creating a Virtual Product

A Virtual Product is a non-tangible product that can be downloaded. Examples include a music file, a video, or an electronic publication. In some cases, a virtual product is defined by a set duration. These virtual products could also include warranties and service contracts. Virtual products may be sold individually or as part of a Grouped Product.

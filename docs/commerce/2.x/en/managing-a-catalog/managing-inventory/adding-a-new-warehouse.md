# Adding a New Warehouse

Warehouses represent physical locations where product inventory is stored. If the [Minium Accelerator](../../starting-a-store/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store.md) was used to create the store, there are three warehouses already created.

```note::
   When adding a new warehouse, users may need to first enable the applicable country and region location of the warehouse (state or province). See `Adding Regions <../../store-administration/adding-regions.md>`_ for more information.
```

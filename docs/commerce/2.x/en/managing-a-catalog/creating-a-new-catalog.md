# Creating a Catalog

A catalog is the complete list of related products that can be displayed on a store site. Multiple catalogs may be created and associated with [channels](./creating-and-managing-products/channels/introduction-to-channels.md).

To create a new catalog:

1. Click the (+) button to add a new catalog.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: Medical Supplies
    * **Default Catalog Language**: (your Language) (for example, _English (United States)_)
    * **Currency**: (your store's currency) (_US Dollar_)

    ![New Catalog](./creating-a-new-catalog/images/01.png)

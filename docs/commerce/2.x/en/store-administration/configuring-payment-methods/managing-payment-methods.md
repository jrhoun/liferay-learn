# Managing Payment Methods

Payment methods in Liferay Commerce scoped by [channel](../../starting-a-store/channels/introduction-to-channels.md) and store [site](../../starting-a-store/sites-and-site-types.md). If a Liferay Commerce instance has more than one storefront hosted on the same instance, administrators can use different payment methods on each site.

To manage payment methods, navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Channels_.

Select the desired channel then click _Edit_ for the payment method for this store site.

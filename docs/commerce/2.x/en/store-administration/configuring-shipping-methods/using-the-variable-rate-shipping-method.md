# Using the Variable Rate Shipping Method

Variable rate shipping allows shipping costs to be calculated using three factors: weight, order subtotal (cost before shipping, taxes, and discounts), and a configurable flat rate. The store administrator may configure the weighting of each factor in the shipping calculation.

Multiple different shipping options with variable rates may be created. For example, a 'Standard Ground' option with a low cost per weight can be created. In contrast, a “Two-Day Air” option can be created that uses the same logic as 'Standard Ground', but has a higher cost per weight.

Variable-rate shipping costs are determined by the following formula:

`shipping costs = [fixed price] + ([order total weight] * [rate unit weight price]) * ([order subtotal] x [rate percentage])`

## Activating the Variable Rate Shipping Method

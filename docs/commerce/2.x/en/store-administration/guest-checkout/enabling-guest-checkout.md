# Enabling Guest Checkout

Users can allow guests to submit orders without first having to sign in. The Guest Checkout function can be enabled or disabled for each [Channel](../managing-a-catalog/creating-and-managing-products/channels/introduction-to-channels.md) (if there are more than one channel on the Commerce instance).

To enable Guest Checkout:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Channels_.
1. Click on the desired channel.
1. On the _General_ tab's _Orders_ section, slide the _Guest Checkout_ toggle to Enabled.
1. Click _Save_.

## Adding an Optional Authentication Widget

1. On the _General_ tab's _Health Checks_ section, click _Fix Issue_ next to _Guest Checkout Authentication_. This creates a new authentication page with an option to sign in as Guest.

    ![Add authentication page](./enabling-guest-checkout/images/02.png)

1. Click _Save_ again when finished.

Guest Checkout has been enabled.

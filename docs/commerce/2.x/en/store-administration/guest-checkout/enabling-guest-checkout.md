# Enabling Guest Checkout

> Commerce 2.1 and Below

Users can allow guests to submit orders without first having to sign in. The Guest Checkout function can be enabled or disabled for each [Channel](../managing-a-catalog/creating-and-managing-products/channels/introduction-to-channels.md) (if there are more than one channel on the Commerce instance).

To enable Guest Checkout:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Channels_.
1. Click on the desired channel.
1. On the _General_ tab's _Orders_ section, slide the _Guest Checkout_ toggle to Enabled.
1. Click _Save_.

    ![Enable Guest Checkout](./enabling-guest-checkout/images/01.png)

Guest Checkout has been enabled.

If you had used the Speedwell Accelerator to build your site, the Email Address field now appears during the checkout process.

Otherwise, use the _Health Checks_ to build a site page with the _Guest Checkout Authentication_ widget.

1. On the _General_ tab's _Health Checks_ section, click _Fix Issue_ next to _Guest Checkout Authentication_. This creates a new authentication page with an option to sign in as Guest.

1. Click _Save_ again when finished.

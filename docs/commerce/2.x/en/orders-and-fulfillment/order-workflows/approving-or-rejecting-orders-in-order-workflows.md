# Approving or Rejecting Orders in Order Workflows

[Order workflows](./introduction-to-order-workflows.md), when enabled, empower the buyer or seller to require internal prior approval for an order before it can be [processed](../orders/processing-an-order.md). This article documents how to approve or reject an order when _Buyer Order Approval Workflow_ or _Seller Order Acceptance Workflow_ is enabled with the out-of-the-box _Single Approver (Version 1)_ option.

## Approving or Rejecting an Order

Once the buyer has submitted his cart for pre-approval, or placed an order for seller-approval, the order can be approved or rejected by the appropriate user as follows:

1. Navigate to _User Administration_ → _My Account_ → _Notifications_.

# Order Information

Administrators can view and edit order information by clicking an order in the [Orders Menu](./orders-menu.md).

There are five tabs: General, Payments, Shipments, Notes, and Emails.

## General

You can manage and track the order's status from start to finish on the _General_ tab.

## Emails

The _Emails_ tab contains all the communications between the buyer and seller.

<!-- I don't think this information is different enough from 2.1 to justify adding it as a separate option. Just because we _can_ add it, doesn't mean we should, and in this case - it really doesn't feel like there's enough justification to keep it. Open to discussing though.

## Commerce 2.0 and Below

# Creating a Discount

Follow the steps below to create a discount by selecting the discount type, the target customers, and setting the discount rates. Once the discount has been created, specify additional conditions to qualify for the discount.

To create a new discount:

1. Go to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Discounts_.
1. Click the (![Add](../images/icon-add.png)) button to add a new Discount.
1. Enter a name: _Spring Sale_.
1. Select a discount type (for example, _Apply to Subtotal_) from the _Target_ drop down. (See [Discount Types](./introduction-to-discounts.md/#types-of-discounts) to learn more about the different discount types.)
1. Check the box for which channel this discount applies to.
1. Select which [Account Groups](../account-management/creating-a-new-account-group.md) this discount applies to. In this example, _US East Coast_.
1. If using a coupon code, switch the _Use Coupon Code_ toggle to _Yes_. Then enter a code in the _Couple Code_ field. Otherwise leave it as _NO_.
1. If using a percentage, switch the _Use Percentage_ toggle to _Yes_. (See [Discount Percentages](./introduction-to-discounts.md/#discount-percentages) to learn more.)
1. Enter the _Maximum Discount Amount_: $20.00
1. Enter the _Level_: 20.00. This takes 20% off the subtotal.
1. Switch the _Active_ toggle to _YES_.

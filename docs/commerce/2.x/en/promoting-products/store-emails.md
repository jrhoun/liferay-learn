# Store Emails

Liferay Commerce includes a series of email notification templates which sends notifications when triggered by a variety of events. These notification templates can be used and reused for multiple events and multiple audiences. For example, when a order is placed, you can use the _Order Placed_ notification template to send one email to the buyer, a different email to the order administrator, and a third email to the sales agent who manages the account.

```note::
   To use Liferay Commerce's Notifications feature, system administrators first have to configure the Mail settings for Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP). See `Connecting to a Mail Server <https://learn.liferay.com/dxp-7.x/installation-and-upgrades/setting-up-liferay-dxp/configuring-mail/connecting-to-a-mail-server.html>`_ for more information.
```

## Store Email Configurations

Email notifications are configured per [channel](../managing-a-catalog/creating-and-managing-products/channels/introduction-to-channels.md). (If you had used an [accelerator like Minium](../starting-a-store/accelerators.md) to create your store, a corresponding channel has already been created.)

## Message Queues

When an event triggers an notification (for example, an order is placed), the notification is placed temporarily in the _Notification Queue_ tab.

## Viewing Order Communications History

Every order logs all the related email notifications. To view all the emails, navigate to an Orderâ€™s Email tab. See [Orders Information](../orders-and-fulfillment/orders/order-information.md) to learn more.

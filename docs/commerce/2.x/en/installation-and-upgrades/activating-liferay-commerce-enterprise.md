# Activating Liferay Commerce Enterprise

> **Subscribers**

Liferay Commerce Enterprise is built on Liferay DXP. In additional to deploying the Liferay Commerce Enterprise `LPKG` file, it is necessary to activate Liferay Commerce Enterprise by deploying an activation key. The activation key is an `XML` file which is then deployed in the Liferay Commerce Enterprise instance.

1. Once the subscriber has purchased the additional Liferay Commerce offering, open a [Help Center](https://liferay-support.zendesk.com/agent/) ticket and request the Liferay Commerce activation key.
1. The Liferay Provisioning Team will provide instructions on how to download the Commerce activation key.
1. Deploy the activation key in the `{liferay.home}\deploy` folder.
1. Verify that the success message appears in the console.
1. Once the activation key has been applied, this instance has been registered.

Liferay Commerce Enterprise is now ready to be used.

    ```log
    2019-08-12 21:53:43.847 INFO  [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][AutoDeployDir:261] Processing Liferay Commerce Enterprise 2.0.5.lpkg
    2019-08-13 18:12:56.713 INFO  [fileinstall-/../../liferay-commerce-enterprise-1.1.6/osgi/marketplace][LPKGArtifactInstaller:202] The portal instance needs to be restarted to complete the installation of file:/../../liferay-commerce-enterprise-1.1.6/osgi/marketplace/Liferay%20Commerce%20-%20API.lpkg
    2019-08-13 18:12:56.715 INFO  [fileinstall-/../../liferay-commerce-enterprise-1.1.6/osgi/marketplace][LPKGArtifactInstaller:202] The portal instance needs to be restarted to complete the installation of file:/../../liferay-commerce-enterprise-1.1.6/osgi/marketplace/Liferay%20Commerce%20-%20Impl.lpkg
    ```

1. Shut down the application server.

## Apply the Latest Fix Pack (Subscribers Only)

Before upgrading Liferay Commerce, update the base Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP) Fix Pack to the latest release. (For example, Liferay Commerce Enterprise 2.0.6 is built on Liferay DXP 7.1 Fix Pack 14.) Fix Packs are applied to the Liferay DXP installation using the Liferay Patching Tool. Apply the fix pack _while the application server is shut down._

1. Download the Patching Tool available from [Help Center]((https://customer.liferay.com/downloads?p_p_id=com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_productAssetCategoryId=118191019&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_fileTypeAssetCategoryId=118191066)).

1. Install the latest Patching Tool.
    > For more information about installing and configuring the Patching Tool, see [Using the Patching Tool](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360018176551-Using-the-Patching-Tool) and [Configuring the Patching Tool](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360018176611-Configuring-the-Patching-Tool).

1. Download the fix pack from [Help Center](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads).
1. Apply the fix pack.

    > See [Installing Patches](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028810512-Installing-Patches).

    > If Liferay DXP was [installed manually](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360017896672-Installing-Liferay-DXP-Manually-) (for example, on WebLogic), see [Installing Patches on the Liferay DXP 7.1 WAR](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360018176651-Installing-patches-on-the-Liferay-DXP-7-1-WAR).


1. Verify that the fix pack has been applied:

```log
Detailed patch list:
  [ -] dxp-12-7110 :: Currently not installed; Won't be installed: dxp-14 contains the fixes included in this one :: Built for LIFERAY
  [*I] dxp-14-7110 :: Installed; Will be installed. :: Built for LIFERAY
```

Note that any previously installed fix packs will be overridden by the latest. After patching, remove Liferay DXP’s cache of deployed code by deleting the contents of the `[Liferay Home]/work folder`. See the next section on how to remove other stale data.

## Clear Stale Data and Verify the Upgrade Process

1. Delete the `${liferay.home}/osgi/state` folder.
    > To learn more about OSGi folders, see [Installing Apps Manually](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017895412-Installing-Apps-Manually#using-your-file-system-to-install-apps).
1. Start the application server.
1. Verify that the the upgrade process has begun by looking for messages similar to this in your application server console logs:

    ```

The Liferay Commerce instance has been upgraded.

## Execute Post-Upgrade Reindex

After upgrading from Liferay Commerce 1.1.x to the latest version, it is necessary to execute a full search reindex because of product changes between major versions.

To execute a search reindex:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Configuration_ → _Search_.
1. Click _Execute_ next to _Reindex all search indexes_.
1. Wait for the reindex to finish.
1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Verify all the products are displayed again.

Once reindexing is complete, the new Liferay Commerce instance is ready for use.
